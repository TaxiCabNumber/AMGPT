* Headers (requires identifying a specific pattern in your documents).
* Footers (similarly requires a specific pattern identification).
* Acknowledgements section (assumes it starts with a heading and ends before the next major section, using lookahead to avoid removing the start of the next section).
* Simple inline mathematical equations (converts them into LaTeX format, only works for equations delimited by $...$).
* Reference markers in square brackets (e.g., [1], [1,2]).
* Single reference markers in parentheses (e.g., (1)).
* Attempt to remove superscript numbers (though this pattern may not accurately match superscript formatting).
* Image captions that start with "Fig" or "Figure" followed by a number and any text until the end of the line.
* Main body text that references figures or tables.
* Hyperlinks (both HTTP and HTTPS URLs as well as www links).
* DOI links that start with "doi:".
* Text after "References" or "Bibliography" headings (only retains the part of the text before these headings).
* Excess newline characters (consolidates multiple newline characters into a single newline to clean up the text)
* Metadata: Remove document metadata that might be included in the text, such as author names, affiliations, or publication dates.
* Page Numbers and Line Numbers: Remove page numbers and line numbers if they are included in the text and not relevant to the content.
* Special Characters: Remove or normalize special characters and symbols that are not relevant to the text content.

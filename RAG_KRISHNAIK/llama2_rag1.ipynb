Accordingly, this paper \\npresents Defect Structure Process Maps (DSPMs) as a means of quantifying the role of porosity as an exemplary \\ndefect structure in powder bed printed materials. Synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography (μSXCT) was \\nused to demonstrate that metal AM defects follow predictable trends within processing parameter space for laser \\npowder bed fusion (LPBF) materials. Ti-6Al-4 V test blocks were fabricated on an EOS M290 utilizing variations \\nin laser power, scan velocity, and hatch spacing. In general, characteristic under-melting or lack-of-fusion defects \\nwere discovered in the low laser power, high scan velocity region of process space via μSXCT. These defects were \\nassociated with insufficient overlap between adjacent melt tracks and can be avoided through the application of \\na lack-of-fusion criterion using melt pool geometric modeling. Large-scale keyhole defects were also successfully \\nmitigated for estimated melt pool morphologies associated with shallow keyhole front wall angles. Process \\nvariable selections resulting in deep keyholes, i.e., high laser power and low scan velocity, exhibit a substantial \\nincrease of spherical porosity as compared to the nominal (manufacturer recommended) processing parameters \\nfor Ti-6Al-4 V. Defects within fully-dense process space were also discovered, and are associated with gas \\nporosity transfer to the AM test blocks during the laser-powder interaction. Overall, this work points to the fact \\nthat large-scale defects in LPBF materials can be successfully predicted and thus mitigated/minimized via \\nappropriate selection of processing parameters.   \\n1.Introduction \\nLaser powder bed fusion (LPBF) metal additive manufacturing (AM) \\ntechniques currently offer the best reproducibility and dimensional ac-\\ncuracy for part production, and therefore have been well-researched in \\nboth industry and academia [1–10]. In general, LPBF techniques use the \\nfollowing steps to fabricate a component: (1) a layer of metal powder of \\nspecified thickness is spread onto the build plate in the machine; (2) the \\ndesired area within the powder layer is selectively melted using a laser \\nbeam; (3) the build plate moves down, and a new layer of powder is \\nspread onto the build plate. This process is repeated layer-by-layer until \\nthe part fabrication is complete. Positive process outcomes for LPBF metal AM builds are controlled by various processing parameters \\nincluding, but not limited to beam power (P), scan velocity (V), hatch \\nspacing (H), layer thickness (D), and scan pattern amongst many others \\n[4–6]. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the combination of \\nthese processing parameters is largely responsible for melt pool geom -\\netry, local microstructure, defect size, and defect morphology [2,3,6,11, \\n12]. Importantly, unwanted LPBF defects such as porosity, inclusions, \\nand oxides are deleterious to the structural integrity and durability of \\nmetal AM components, particularly in aerospace and biomedical appli -\\ncations where premature failure (e.g., fatigue) is primarily controlled by \\nthe defect structure [3,7,9,10,13,14].

Masuo et al. [16] determined that processing defects (including \\nsurface roughness) limited the fatigue strength of the as-fabricated \\nspecimens to approximately 1/3 of the fatigue strength for wrought \\nTi-6Al-4 V. Therefore, process-defect-property relationships are impor -\\ntant to connect relevant processing parameters to resulting defect dis-\\ntributions to certify metal AM processes and components, particularly \\nfor structural materials and biomedical applications. \\nIn general, defects can be created or transferred to the finished part \\nin three specific ways, namely through: (1) transfer from the feedstock \\npowder, (2) the laser-powder-metal interaction during melting, and (3) \\npost-processing treatments [1–4,8,11,12]. Overall, four different types \\nof defects are observed in LPBF, namely: lack-of-fusion porosity, keyhole \\nporosity, balling, and gas porosity [8]. In order to limit defect generation \\nwithin metal AM builds, all three mechanisms of pore formation or \\ntransfer must be considered and controlled through appropriate selec-\\ntion of processing parameters. Of these, the laser-powder-metal inter-\\naction is the most common means of porosity transfer during metal AM \\nprocessing [1–3], where defects such as “keyhole ” and “lack-of-fusion ” \\n(LOF) porosity can be generally observed [11,12,17–19]. In more detail, \\nthe lack-of-fusion porosity boundary can be determined by whether \\nthere is sufficient overlap between melt pools to ensure that all points \\nare melted at least once [20]. LOF porosity has also been recently shown \\nto form due to the interaction of ejected particles/spatter with the laser \\nand meltpool in [21]. Large spatter may not be fully melted during laser \\nscanning, thus becoming potential sites of pore generation as shown by \\nthe string of lack-of-fusion pores are generated around the spatter in \\n[21]. In contrast, the keyhole porosity boundary corresponds to in-\\nstabilities in deep keyholes leading to pinching-off of pores [22]. A third \\nboundary (known as the “beading-up ” boundary) is determined by a \\ncombination of fluid flow patterns and capillary instability of the melt \\npool and is a limiting factor for increasing production rates while \\nmaintaining precision (e.g., increasing velocity and power simulta -\\nneously) in LPBF AM systems [23,24]. Overall LOF, keyhole, and \\nbead-up porosity boundaries in particular define an effective “process \\nwindow ” for production of parts with nominally full density; within that \\nprocess window, porosity is transferred from the powder to the part [8, \\n21,24]. Accordingly, LOF and keyhole porosity boundaries will be the \\nmain focus of this paper, along with examination of the way in which \\npore content varies by particle size. Full density can be quantified as \\nsamples possessing >99.9 % volumetric density, although it should be \\nnoted that large defects are still possible. The aim is to optimize pro-\\ncessing parameters, reduce unwanted defects in LPBF AM materials, and \\nultimately demonstrate that it is feasible to operate LPBF machines \\nwithin a process window defined by defect content. \\nThis study is intended to build upon previous investigations of the \\neffect of processing parameters on the defect distribution in LPBF of Ti- \\n6Al-4 V [25]. This work builds on that preliminary research to show that \\nfully-dense Ti-6Al-4 V metal AM parts can be produced based on melt \\npool geometric modeling [20] and recently obtained information on \\nkeyhole morphological trends and porosity formation during high-speed \\ndynamic x-ray scanning of LPBF Ti-6Al-4V [22]. Since different alloys \\nrespond in a similar fashion in LPBF [20], the expectation is that the \\nDefect Structure Process Maps (DSPMs) approach can be applied to all \\nfusible alloys. This will be accomplished by mapping out the defect \\ndensity variation within laser power-scan velocity (P-V) space [6], \\nincluding a comparison of standard (manufacturer recommended) pro-\\ncessing parameters for Ti-6Al-4V cubes. A second goal of this work is to \\ninvestigate the formation and retention of gas porosity within the \\nTi-6Al-4 V powders and as-fabricated components resulting from \\nentrapped gas within individual powder granules, as shown by Cun-\\nningham et al. [25]. Thus, the intended application of this knowledge is \\nin the construction of DSPMs for fully-dense part-level builds for LPBF \\nTi-6Al-4V, therefore improving the reliability of printing this material \\nand other materials using powder bed additive machines via control of defect density. \\n2.Materials and methods \\n2.1. Experimental setup \\nAs previously reported [25], plasma atomized EOS Ti-6Al-4V alloy \\npowder was used to fabricate test blocks (cubes) on an EOS M290 LPBF \\nmachine. A total of 12 test blocks were produced utilizing a variation of \\nprocessing parameters including laser power P, laser speed V, and hatch \\nspacing H, as given in Table 1. The recommended EOS standard values of \\nP=280W and V=1,200 mm/s for Ti-6Al-4 V were used to produce \\nSample 1, which served as a baseline for comparison with the other \\nsamples that were produced utilizing the processing parameters given in \\nTable 1. Processing parameters for these samples were chosen to span \\nP-V space around the nominal (manufacturer recommended) values \\navailable for EOS Ti-6Al-4 V for the purpose of understanding the effect \\nof velocity (Samples 2-5), power (Samples 6, 7, 8, and 9), and hatch \\nspacing (Samples 5, 8, 10, 11, 12) on defect density (Table 1) [25]. In \\nSamples 2-5 where velocity is varied at a nominal power of 280W, hatch \\nspacing is decreased in Sample 5 as per the geometric model to avoid \\nlack-of-fusion porosity at a high velocity of 1500 mm/s. In samples with \\nvarying power at a nominal velocity of 1200 mm/s, hatch spacing is \\ndecreased in Sample 8 as per the geometric model to avoid lack-of-fusion \\nporosity at lower power of 100W. In addition to Samples 5 and 8, hatch \\nspacing is changed in Samples 10, 11, and 12. At a nominal power and \\nvelocity, hatch spacing is increased in Sample 10 to introduce \\nlack-of-fusion porosity as per the geometric model and hatch spacing is \\ndecreased in Sample 11 to double the overlap depth and quadruple the \\noverlap between adjacent melt tracks. On the other hand, in Sample 12, \\npower, velocity, and hatch spacing are changed from the nominal con-\\nditions. An increase in power and a decrease in velocity is accompanied \\nby an increase in hatch spacing as per the geometric model. The idea is \\nto use the geometric model to avoid LOF porosity and single melt track \\nexperiments to know the keyhole boundary and then select processing \\nparameters to increase the deposition rate. For all the samples, a slice \\nlayer thickness of L =30μm was used for all the test blocks and a \\nnominal spot size of ~100 μm (as per the technical specifications pro-\\nvided by the machine manufacturer). \\n2.2. Synchrotron-based micro-tomography \\nHigh-energy μSXCT was performed at the Advanced Photon Source \\n(APS) to measure the size and morphology of defects (pores) within both \\npowders and the printed Ti-6Al-4V test blocks as reported by Cunning -\\nham et al. [25]. As-fabricated μSXCT samples with dimensions of \\n1mm×9mm×15mm were extracted from the top 1.5mm3 volume \\nof each test block with longer dimension parallel to build direction. \\nμSXCT was performed in white beam mode with a total of 1500 pro-\\njections taken over 180◦with a 50ms exposure time. A voxel size of \\n0.65 μm was used, resulting in a minimum detectable pore size of about \\n1.5μm. Three-dimensional μSXCT volumes were reconstructed using \\nthe TomoPy 0.0.3.15 and AVIZO by FEI™ 9.1.1 software. Pore \\nmorphology (i.e. \"spherical\" versus \"non-spherical\" designations) was \\ndetermined using the ‘anisotropy ’ function in Avizo 9 with a value of 0.5 \\nbeing the cutoff for \"spherical\". While morphology is not a conclusive \\nmetric for determining the defect formation mechanism, it is reasonable \\nto assume that highly spherical pores are likely to be formed from \\ninsoluble gas bubbles trapped during solidification (e.g. either gas or \\nkeyholing pores), while largely irregular pores are likely LOF defects \\n[8]. For this analysis, the following quantitative metrics for porosity \\ndesignation were utilized: (a) LOF pores (>40µm and spherical), (b) \\nkeyholing pores (>40µm and spherical) and, (c) gas pores (<20µm and \\nspherical). Each reconstructed 3D data set contains \\n2560×2560×2100 three dimensional voxels, yielding a total data size \\nover 40 GB. This data volume implies that automated analysis methods J.V.

For more specific \\ndetails in setup and experimental procedures, the reader is referred to \\nRef. [25]. \\n2.3. Machine learning-based segmentation and analysis of trapped gas \\nporosity \\nAs a preliminary to analysis of built materials, variety of feedstock \\npowders were examined to determine pore statistics. Depending on \\nprocessing parameters, a substantial fraction of powder pores appears to \\nbe carried over into built parts, so it is critical to be aware of initial pore \\npopulations and to include the elimination of such pores during melting \\nin the consideration of optimal parameter choices. At least thousands of \\nparticles are used to build macroscopic parts and samples, so the task is \\ndaunting. Machine learning (ML) techniques [26] were used to locate \\nand segment the powder particles in tomographic data sets. For an \\nautomated procedure, the first task is to identify powder particles and \\nseparate them from the background in reconstructed 3D data sets that \\nhave a variety of signal-to-noise ratios. As compared to other software \\nsuch as ImageJ [27] or ilastik , [28] machine learning algorithms are \\nconvenient for at least three reasons, namely: (1) enhanced memory \\nefficiency, (2) possible porting of optimized batch processes to parallel \\nprocessing, and (3) the existence of simple graphical user interface (GUI) \\nformats for training the model. A general description of the ML tech-\\nnique used in this study is presented here. First, a set of n 3-D image \\nfilters (typically based on convolutions using different masks) were \\napplied to the reconstructed μSXCT data in order to take the information \\ncharacterizing the neighborhood of voxels into account. The intensity I \\n(x, y, z), and resultant feature vector, F(x, y, z), of length n were then \\ngenerated at each voxel location. For example, the ith element of F(x, y, \\nz), Fi(x, y, z), is the value obtained using the ith filter applied to the \\nlocation (x, y, z). Next, each voxel in a training data set was assigned a \\nlabel, l, to provide the model with examples of powder material voxels \\nand background voxels. Material voxels were labelled with 1 and \\nbackground with 0. This procedure was used to generate a set of labels l \\n(x, y, z) along with the corresponding feature vector at each voxel \\nlocation. \\nAfter the above procedure was carried out, the model was trained \\nusing the corresponding label and feature vectors of the example voxels \\nto automatically learn a complicated relation between labels and fea-\\ntures. Finally, the model was used to assign labels to voxels in the entire \\ndata set from their feature vectors. In this way, a binary output of \\nsegmented 3-D images was obtained: 1 for particle material and 0 for \\nlow density, background or void regions. Porosity within the powder \\nparticles was identified as void regions that are surrounded by particle voxels in 3-D space. Finally, these binary data sets were well handled by \\nthe commercial software, AVIZO for statistical analysis. Statistical in-\\nformation including powder size, porosity distribution, and morphology \\nwere extracted from these volumetric data sets. \\n3.Results and discussion \\n3.1. Prediction and μSXCT validation of the LOF porosity boundary for \\nTi-6Al-4V \\nLOF porosity is discernable by large, irregularly shaped pores which \\ncan be particularly deleterious to mechanical behavior [15,29–32]; they \\noften contain unmelted powder particles. These defects are normally \\nattributed to incorrect processing parameter selection as well as laser \\nbeam fluctuations, surface gas flow, and raw material characteristics \\n[33,34] such that not all locations in the powder bed are melted. For the \\nTi-6Al-4 V processing parameters investigated, it can be readily \\nobserved that LOF porosity occupies the low laser power, high laser scan \\nvelocity region within P-V space as shown in Fig. 1 [4]. This behavior \\nagrees with other investigations pointing to low power input, or alter-\\nnatively low energy density as the primary source of LOF porosity [4]. \\nNote, Fig. 1 only contains samples possessing a hatch spacing of 140 μm, \\nand this value was used to estimate defect (porosity) boundaries in this \\nwork. Furthermore, this hatch spacing of 140 μm will be the focus of this \\nwork when discussing the process windows for lack-of-fusion, keyhole, \\nand gas porosity. \\nRecent investigations of LOF porosity confirm this finding that \\nrelative densities for LPBF materials produced utilizing different pro-\\ncessing parameters may vary by as much as 5 % although they possess \\nthe same energy density showing that energy density alone is not a \\nrobust predictor of porosity formation [20]. Investigations on LPBF \\nAlSi10Mg builds also support this, pointing to the ineffectiveness of this \\nenergy density criterion alone in consistently predicting porosity [35]. If \\nhatch spacing is increased and layer thickness is decreased by the same \\nproportion, energy density remains the same. In the geometric model \\n[20], the key parameter is the minimum depth of melting (overlap depth \\nbetween the adjacent melt pools) compared to the layer thickness. The \\nminimum depth of melting does not depend on hatch spacing and layer \\nthickness the same way as energy density. This can easily be seen by \\nchoosing a hatch spacing that is greater than the melt pool width. The \\nminimum depth of melting is zero and lack-of-fusion will occur for any \\nlayer thickness. However, a constant value of energy density can still be \\nmaintained by a proportionally smaller layer thickness. Therefore, a \\nsimple geometric model as described by Tang et al. [35] was used to \\npredict the LOF porosity boundary for Ti-6Al-4 V test blocks within P-V \\nspace, as shown in Fig. 2. The geometric criterion for insufficient melting \\nof the material and therefore LOF porosity is captured in Eq. 1: Table 1 \\nList of processing parameters used to produce LPBF Ti-6Al-4 V test blocks [25].  \\nSample \\nNumber Power, P \\n(W) Velocity, V \\n(mm/s) Hatch Spacing, \\nH (μm) Calculated melt pool \\ndepth, D (μm) L/D \\nratio H/W \\nratio Energy density, E \\n(J/mm3) Volume % \\nSpherical Pores Volume % \\nIrregular Pores \\n1 280 1,200 140 84 0.35 0.83 56 0.00077 0.0056 \\n2 280 400 140 144 0.21 0.49 167 0.67 1.69 \\n3 280 800 140 102 0.29 0.68 83 0.0092 0.052 \\n4 280 1,000 140 92 0.32 0.76 67 0.00073 0.00023 \\n5 280 1,500 80 75 0.4 0.53 44 0.000096 0.00013 \\n6 370 1,200 140 96 0.31 0.73 73 0.00019 0.00010 \\n7 325 1,200 140 90 0.33 0.78 64 0.00041 0.00050 \\n8 100 1,200 50 50 0.6 0.50 56 0.0012 0.11 \\n9 165 1,200 140 64 0.47 1.1 33 0.0015 0.34 \\n10 280 1,200 160 84 0.36 0.95 49 0.0010 0.015 \\n11 280 1,200 40 84 0.36 0.24 194 0.0093 0.005 \\n12 370 1,000 240 105 0.29 1.14 51 0.0015 0.021 \\nNote: Melt pool width, W=2*D assuming the shape of the melt pool is semi-circular.

Previous work calculating melt pool dimensions involving these \\nprocessing parameters were based on experimental results, however the \\ngoal here is to provide the means for calculating melt pool dimensions \\nanalytically and to show that relatively simple equations can work well \\nin predicting LOF porosity. \\nUsing the estimated melt pool widths (Eq. 2) in conjunction with Eq. \\n1, a LOF boundary in P-V space was determined for the Ti-6Al-4 V test \\nblocks, e.g. the dotted black line separating Specimens 1, 4, 6, and 7 \\nfrom Specimen 9 in Fig. 1. The μSXCT results show that large, irregular \\nLOF defects are present within Sample 9, which lies below the estimated \\nLOF boundary in Fig. 1 [4]. Fig. 2 illustrates the melt pool geometric \\nvalues plotted against Eq. 1, namely (H/W) vs. (L/D). The solid line in \\nFig. 2 designates values of ((H/W)2 +(L/D)2) equal to 1. For values \\nmuch less than 1, the geometric model assumes that full overlap can be \\nrealized, and therefore reduced occurrence of LOF porosity. Conversely, \\nas values approach and exceed 1, LOF porosity is expected. The geo-\\nmetric model also assumes that as ((H/W)2 +(L/D)2) values decrease (or \\nincrease) further away from 1, LOF porosity will continue to decrease (or \\nincrease). This can be seen in the μSXCT results for Samples 1, 4, 6, and 7 \\n(see Fig. 2). Sample 7 had a similar ((H/W)2 +(L/D)2) value as Sample 1, \\nwhile Samples 4 and 6 possessed reduced ((H/W)2 +(L/D)2) values \\ncompared to Sample 1 and reduced irregular defect content. As ((H/W)2 \\n+(L/D)2) values decreased, irregular defect content seems to decrease \\nas well, as shown in Fig. 2. Sample 6 possessed the smallest ((H/W)2 +\\n(L/D)2) value and volume % of irregular LOF pores; consequently \\nSample 9 possessed the largest ((H/W)2 +(L/D)2) value and greatest \\nvolume % of irregular LOF pores. This trend was observed for all spec-\\nimens analyzed with hatch spacing values of 140 μm (Fig. 2). \\nThe reduction of LOF porosity below the LOF boundary in Ti-6Al-4 V \\nas shown for the Samples 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9 can be characterized by melt \\npool geometric properties. Overall, Samples 1, 4, 6, and 7 possess ((H/ \\nW)2 +(L/D)2) values less than 1, e.g. below the LOF boundary line in \\nFig. 2. On the other hand, Sample 9 has a ((H/W)2 +(L/D)2) value 43 % \\ngreater than 1, leading to 0.34 % irregular (e.g., LOF) porosity (Fig. 2). \\nComparatively, Sample 1 below the LOF boundary possessed less than \\n0.0056 % irregular porosity. Therefore, it is deduced that occurrence of \\nlarge-scale LOF defects above the LOF boundary for Sample 9 is mainly a \\nconsequence of insufficient melt pool overlap [35]. Melt pool overlap \\ncan be characterized via both H/W and L/D ratios (Fig. 2, insert). For an \\nL/D ratio <1, the geometric model assures sufficient vertical overlap. By \\nincreasing overlap depth, L/D ratio is reduced and consequently LOF is \\nlowered. Consequently, H/W values (lateral overlap) should also remain \\nbelow 1 as well to limit sensitivity to process settings (Fig. 2) [20]. \\nSamples 1,4, 6, and 7 possess greatly reduced L/D and H/W ratios than \\nSample 9, and therefore experience more melt pool overlap and reduced \\noccurrence of LOF (irregular) porosity. More analysis is necessary to fully determine the limits of applying the geometric criterion, however \\nfor process outcomes in LPBF Ti-6Al-4 V, the geometric criterion can \\nprovide satisfactory estimates of the potential for large-scale LOF \\nporosity and can be used to increase build rates while maintaining \\nfully-dense parts [20]. \\n3.2. μSXCT validation of the keyhole porosity boundary in Ti-6Al-4V \\nA power density at the metal surface greater than 106 W/cm2 may \\nresult in a transition of melt pool geometry from semi-circular “con-\\nduction mode ” to deep and narrow “keyhole mode ” for Ti-6Al-4 V \\n[38–40]. Keyhole mode occurrence is often identified using melt pool \\ndepth-to-width (D/W) ratio (melt pool cross-sectional aspect ratio) is >\\n0.5 [41]. High speed visualization with synchrotron x-rays has, how-\\never, shown that there is a well-defined threshold in power density for \\nkeyhole formation [22]. During keyhole mode, large and spherical \\nkeyhole defects may be generated as a result of operating within the \\nhigh-power, low-velocity region of process space (Fig. 1). The formation \\nof these defects is strongly dependent on the choice of laser spot size and \\nthe boiling point for a specific material [8]. During keyhole mode, the \\nabsorptivity (i.e., net energy absorption) increases to values much \\ngreater than in conduction mode due to multiple reflections of the beam \\nin the vapor cavity formed where the laser intersects the melt pool. This \\nenables the laser to “drill” to a deeper depth in the material, generating \\nelongated melt pools and a pronounced vapor cavity in the center of the \\ncross-sectional melt pool [39,42,43]. Keyholes with large aspect ratios \\nexhibit front wall fluctuations that can result in the generation of bub-\\nbles (keyhole porosity), via pinch-off of the bottom of the keyhole, that \\ncan remain within the part after solidification [8,22]. \\nRecent work has shown that the occurrence of keyhole porosity in \\nmetal AM is a result of instability of the base of the vapor depression (i. \\ne., keyhole) that leaves pores behind as the laser moves away from the \\nmelt pool. Such instability is directly related to high aspect ratios in the \\ncavities which occur in the upper left corner of the P-V space, i.e., high \\npower and low speed, for a given spot size [22]. Therefore, quantifying \\ndefect content throughout P-V space allows estimation of the keyhole \\nporosity boundary for LPBF Ti-6Al-4 V across process space. In [22], \\nhigh power and low velocity combinations resulted in unstable mor-\\nphologies for deep keyhole melt pools and subsequent porosity within \\nin-situ dynamic x-ray radiography (DXR) single-bead samples. Further -\\nmore, even in unstable keyhole meltpools, the extent or occurrence of \\nporosity is not constant. Therefore accurate, real-time keyhole \\nmorphological data has great potential to serve as a helpful predictors of \\nkeyhole porosity within process space. \\nThe elongation of the melt pool in the depth direction is indeed the \\nkey defining factor for a keyhole melt pool. As mentioned previously, a \\ncertain severity of keyholing is necessary to generate keyhole wall \\nfluctuations resulting in a pinched off gas bubble (pore) into the melt \\npool. Fig. 3 shows a schematic of the transfer of keyhole porosity to the \\nmelt pool via front wall fluctuations. Notably, keyhole wall fluctuations \\nresulting in porosity have been found to correlate with keyhole front \\nwall angle (θ) in laser welding [44]. Cunningham et al. [22] found that \\nfor θ values greater than 77◦, large-scale keyhole porosity was formed in \\nLPBF Ti-6Al-4 V. It should also be noted that the wall angle criterion \\nseems to behave in a similar fashion as the melt pool width /laser spot \\nsize criterion developed in [33]. At this time, it appears that either cri-\\nterion can be used depending on the application. \\nTo analyze severity of keyholing resulting in keyhole porosity for the \\nTi-6Al-4V test blocks, the melt pool depth and morphological data of Ti- \\n6Al-4V DXR single track experiments from [22] were plotted against the \\nTi-6Al-4V test blocks in this study. Fig. 4 shows the Ti-6Al-4 V test blocks \\nprinted in the high power, low velocity regions of P-V space plotted \\nagainst DXR Ti-6Al-4V melt pool morphologies of θ >77◦in [22]. It can \\nbe readily observed that Sample 2 of the Ti-6Al-4V test blocks is well \\nwithin the keyhole porosity regime (θ >77◦). This resulted in large-scale \\nkeyhole defects, with spherical (keyhole) porosity values of J.V.

However, Samples 1, and 4 have θ <77◦and \\nminimal spherical porosity, with a minimum of approximately 0.00073 \\n% for Sample 3 (Fig. 4). This value is negligible compared to Sample 2, \\nwhich is consistent with large-scale keyhole porosity occurring for θ >\\n77◦. However, Sample 3 also contained spherical keyhole porosity \\n(0.052 %), despite having a front wall angle θ <77◦. This suggests that \\napproach may need to be re-visited. More investigations are indicated \\nbut this present work confirms the DXR trends described in [22]. \\nFor an analysis of the Ti-6Al-4 V test blocks outside of the keyhole \\nboundary (i.e., θ <77◦), the following remarks can be made. Keyhole \\nfront wall angle is a function of laser velocity (Vw) and power density \\ndependent drill rate (Vd), namely [44]:  \\ntan\\x00θ=Vw\\nVd(3) Note, Vd is the component of laser velocity acting perpendicular to \\nthe surface i.e., the velocity that results in the penetration of the laser \\nbeam into the material [44]. Therefore, as laser velocity is increased, \\nkeyhole front wall angle is decreased and thus keyhole porosity is \\nreduced for constant Vd. Drill rate was calculated via the time resolved \\nvapor depression penetration depths from stationary in-situ DXR ex-\\nperiments at identical P-V combinations as utilized for test block fabri-\\ncation [8]. Fig. 4 shows this, with a noticeable difference in defect \\ndensities that occurs between Samples 3 and 4. While Sample 3 displays \\nnoticeable small, round defects, Samples 4 (P=280 W) and 6 (P=370 \\nW) display negligible porosity owing to an increased laser velocity of \\n200 mm/s in both the cases. Although the defects observed in Sample 3 \\nare deduced to be keyhole porosity, these μSXCT scan volumes could \\nalso potentially contain some spherical gas porosity from powder. \\nFig. 3.Schematic of time sequence (a-c) showing the transfer of keyholing porosity from the vapor depression to the baseplate during DXR experiments in [8] for a \\nkeyhole front wall angle (θ) greater than 77◦.

Although Sample 10 is designed to result in \\nlack-of-fusion porosity, the percentage of lack-of-fusion pores is low. \\nBoth these observations suggest that (i) closely spaced tracks can result \\nin temperature build-up that can increase the susceptibility of keyhole \\nformation and result in spherical pores even at non-keyhole parameter \\ncombinations; and (ii) hemispherical melt pool shape assumption breaks \\ndown at certain regions in the process space and this, in turn, can shift \\nthe process window for lack-of-fusion porosity. Similarly, in the case of \\nSample 8, the parameters are not designed for lack-of-fusion porosity, \\nbut the sample consisted of lack-of-fusion pores which also suggests that \\nthe assumption of hemispherical melt pool shape has to be applied with \\ncaution when using the geometrical model for lack-of-fusion porosity. \\nSamples 5 and 12 are the cases designed for maximizing the deposition \\nrate while using different power, velocity, and hatch spacing combina -\\ntions. In Sample 5, velocity is increased to result in a higher deposition \\nrate and to account for the smaller resulting smaller melt pool size, hatch \\nspacing is decreased to 80μm. Whereas, in Sample 12, hatch spacing is \\nincreased to 240 μm to result in a higher deposition rate as an increase in \\npower to 370W would result in larger melt pools. Interestingly, few \\nlack-of-fusion pores were observed in Sample 12 whereas Sample 5 did \\nnot show any significant spherical or irregular pores. This observation \\nalso emphasizes the importance of melt pool geometry and variability, \\nespecially when using larger hatch spacings such as 240 μm which is \\n100 μm higher than the nominal hatch spacing. Overall, optimal hatch \\nspacing to allow sufficient re-melting and while at the same time not \\nresulting in temperature build-up can reduce the overall porosity \\nobserved in Sample 5. \\nLastly, it should be noted that the discrepancies in Samples 10 and 12 \\nare because they correspond to H/W values near 1. Thus, inaccuracies of \\nthe assumed melt pool shape and variability in actual melt pool size and \\nshape are most apparent when the predicted bead overlap is small or nonexistent. For specimen 8, melt pool variability does not play a sig-\\nnificant factor, but instead it is likely that the assumed melt pool shape is \\nthe sole issue. This is because the predicted width of the melt pool is \\nsimilar to the laser spot size whereas a hemispherical melt pool is only \\nvalid for a point heat source. \\n3.3. An automated ML approach to characterizing gas porosity within AM \\npowders \\nGiven that a fraction of the porosity contained in the feedstock \\npowder is transmitted to the printed metal, it is useful to develop \\ncharacterization methods that link pore size to particle size. Metal LPBF \\nAM powders are manufactured in numerous ways, with three of the most \\ncommon being gas atomization, plasma atomization (PA), and plasma \\nrotating electrode (PREP) techniques [46–48]. For PA, multiple plasmas \\nare accelerated by the atomizing inert (argon) gas, with wire melting \\nand atomization occurring in a single step [49]. PREP processing also \\noperates in an inert environment and uses a rotating anode that is melted \\nby an electric arc, forming liquid droplets that are further atomized and \\nsolidified into spherical particles [50]. However, inert gas trapped \\nwithin individual powder particles can result in non-trivial laser-powder \\ndefects during metal AM processing [2,3,20,51,52], where the transfer \\nof gas porosity to as-fabricated AM parts is dependent on both pro-\\ncessing parameters and melt pool dynamics [11]. Therefore, individual \\npowder particles and entrapped gas porosity within EOS plasma atom -\\nized and PREP Ti-6Al-4 V powders were investigated to quantify if \\nhigher porosity powders will also result in higher porosity parts in metal \\nAM LPBF builds (Fig. 4). In particular, a detailed investigation of indi-\\nvidual gas pores as a function of powder particle size was undertaken \\nsince it is useful to know whether or not pore size scales with powder \\nparticle size. Electron beam powder bed uses coarser powders, for \\nexample, which might mean that we would expect larger pores [25]. \\nFig. 5 compares pore size versus enclosing particle size in both PA \\nand PREP powders utilizing ML segmentation and analysis techniques. \\nThe segmentation procedures used in this analysis are described above \\nin Section 2.3. Note that the lower limit of sizes is determined by the \\nFig. 5.P-V locations of remaining specimens with hatch spacings different from 140 μm [25].  J.V.

Note, “particle fraction with pores ” was utilized to compare the \\ntwo powders in Fig. 5b since more PA powder particles (~5,000) were \\nmeasured than PREP particles (~ 3,100) due to the fact that PREP mean \\nparticle size was larger than mean PA particle size resulting in more PA \\nparticles per CT volume. The pore radii for PREP and PA powders in \\nFig. 6a and 6b were determined assuming spherical geometries, e.g., \\nV=4/3πR3, where R is the radius. Overall, PREP powders possessed a \\nlarger value for mean pore radius than PA powders. The PREP powder \\nalso contained a much lower amount of both small and large pores than \\nthe PA powders, as shown in Fig. 6b. For any PA Ti-6Al-4 V powder \\nradius, the pore size distribution is broadly distributed, spanning \\nroughly a factor of ten. This signifies that there is not a strong correlation \\nbetween powder radius (e.g., size) and pore radius for this \\nmanufacturing technique, contrary to the intuitive expectation that pore \\nsize might scale with particle size. These results agree with the results of \\nindividual pore size and powder size reported in [49]. Closer examina -\\ntion of the PREP powder in Fig. 6a (red points) shows a curious feature of \\ntwo branches whereby a subset of particles appears to have pore sizes \\nthat scale with particle size, whereas the rest of the particles have only \\nvery small pores (Fig. 6a).

Comparatively, both PA and PREP powders \\npossessed similar trends in anisotropy values (i.e., sphericity), therefore \\nit is difficult to draw strong conclusions on the difference in morphology \\nbetween the two powder types. \\n3.4. Analysis of gas porosity transfer to the as-fabricated Ti-6Al-4 V test \\nblocks \\nAlthough major LOF and keyhole porosity may be avoided through \\nthe appropriate choice of LPBF processing parameters, gas porosity may \\nstill exist within the process window for fully-dense parts (Fig. 1). As mentioned previously, gas porosity is due to the fact that typical starting \\npowder feedstock materials made via gas or plasma atomization may \\npossess non-trivial amounts of entrapped gas within individual powder \\ngranules [49,50]. Upon laser melting, this is likely to result in gas bubble \\ntransfer to the melt pool during laser melting [1,2]. Fig. 7 directly vi-\\nsualizes gas pore transfer to the melt pool during the laser powder \\ninteraction captured via ultrafast DXR scanning of Ti-6Al-4 V utilizing a \\nstationary laser, i.e., spot welding [8]. In Fig. 7(top right), a powder \\nparticle containing a gas bubble (circled in red) is located adjacent to the \\nlaser beam and pulled into the melt pool (b–c). Once inside, the \\nentrapped gas bubble may exit or remain within the melt pool \\ndepending on the competition between Marangoni convection and \\nbuoyancy forces (d–i). For the Ti-6Al-4 V test blocks within the process \\nwindow (see Fig. 1), it is deduced that the small-scale defects present \\nwithin the μSXCT are indeed gas porosity inherited from the powder. \\nFurthermore, gas porosity transfer to the melt pool into the Ti6Al-4 V \\ntest blocks may originate from powder particles adjacent to the scan \\npath, as shown by the schematic in Fig. 7 (bottom) and which is \\nconsistent with the particle denudation mechanism pointed out by \\nKhairallah et al. [50]. However, further analysis to draw stronger con-\\nclusions is warranted. \\nTo verify that the porosity observed within μSXCT scan volumes \\nwithin the process window (namely Samples 1,4,6,7 in Fig. 1) may \\nindeed be gas pores, the transfer of gas porosity from the powder to as- \\nfabricated Ti-6Al-4 V test blocks was investigated for two further Ti-6Al- \\n4V test blocks utilizing both EOS PA and PREP powders. The test blocks \\nwere printed utilizing processing parameters similar to Sample 6 \\n(P=340W, V=1,250 mm/s, H =120 μm, L =60μm) that were well \\nwithin the process window region of P-V space (Fig. 1). Fig. 8a and 8b \\ndisplay the gas porosity distributions within the EOS PA and PREP metal \\npowders and the resultant as-fabricated test blocks. It appears that gas \\npores do indeed transfer into the Ti-6Al-4 V LPBF part via the mecha -\\nnism detailed in the modeling work of Khairallah et al. [50] (Fig. 7), and \\nthat the distribution of spherical porosity is significantly higher in the \\nPA metal powder, than in the PREP powders (Fig. 8a) [49]. This is \\ndeduced to be resultant from a lower distribution of gas porosity within \\nPREP powders than gas atomized powders for the Ti-6Al-4 V powders \\nused in this study (Fig. 6 and Fig. 8). Importantly, for the gas atomized \\npowders the transfer of gas porosity to as-fabricated part was shown to \\nbe minimal, with the maximum spherical equivalent diameter (SED) of \\ngas porosity of ~ 25μm in the as-fabricated test blocks. Comparatively, \\nthe PREP contained maximum gas porosity SED values of approximately \\n21μm.

Although \\nthere is a possibility that these defects are keyhole porosity, generally \\nkeyhole pores are large and spherical [2]. Therefore, it is currently un-\\nclear what type of porosity these observed defects are, and more analysis \\nis needed to characterize these shapes. Furthermore, it is important to \\nnote that powder characteristics such as particle size distribution, flow, \\ntap density, packing density, chemistry, and morphology can all influ-\\nence build quality and resultant porosity distributions. \\n4.Conclusion \\nThe effect of processing parameters on porosity formation for LPBF \\nTi-6Al-4 V was analyzed using synchrotron based micro-computed to-\\nmography. In general, it was discovered that porosity formation follows \\npredictable trends within P-V space for this material and processing \\ntechnique. Gas porosity was also investigated utilizing two Ti-6Al-4 V \\nmetal AM powders in order to determine the amount of gas pore transfer \\nfrom the powder to the part during the laser melting. Overall the \\nfollowing conclusions are briefly stated here:  \\n•The overlap of melt pools and melt pool depth are main driving \\nfactors for lack-of-fusion porosity. Thus, the use of geometric \\nmodeling techniques that take melt pool geometry and overlap into \\naccount enables rapid prediction of the effects of changing key pro-\\ncessing parameters on LOF porosity. Furthermore, geometric \\nmodeling may be applicable for a wide range of materials and pro-\\ncessing parameters sets within P-V space.  \\n•In keeping with previous work [20], a simple Rosenthal model was \\nused to approximate melt pool dimensions in the geometric modeling \\nof lack-of-fusion; however, more complex models of melt pool di-\\nmensions can be used instead with expected increases in prediction \\naccuracy.  \\n•Processing parameter-dependent keyhole morphologies are deduced \\nto play a key role in keyhole porosity formation. For estimated \\nkeyhole morphologies above the keyhole boundary large scale de-\\nfects were present within the Ti-6Al-4 V test blocks. Large-scale \\nkeyhole defects were located in the characteristic high power, low \\nvelocity regions of the process space in metal powder AM. At this \\ntime, it appears that criteria based on keyhole front wall angle or \\n(from the literature) the ratio of melt pool width to spot size can \\nequivalently be used to establish the transition to keyholing with \\nprocessing parameter changes.  \\n•On the order of 90 % of porosity in the powder can be eliminated by \\nAM processing due to pore bubbles reaching the melt pool surface. \\nProcessing parameters can be manipulated within the processing \\nwindow to enhance this effect yielding essentially defect-free \\ndeposits.  \\n•Further characterization and quantification of metal AM defects may \\nresult in an expanded process window for Ti-6Al-4 V and increased \\ndeposition efficiency. \\nCRediT authorship contribution statement \\nJerard V.

Additive manufactur-\\ning technologies offer enhanced design capabilities for\\ngeometric freedom that allows producing parts which are\\notherwise not possible to fabricate with traditional manu-\\nfacturing processes. There are various additive\\nmanufacturing processes such as selective laser melting,\\ndirect laser deposition, electron beam melting, wire-feed\\nadditive manufacturing, shape deposition modeling, ultra-\\nsonic consolidation, binder jetting, and friction freeform\\nfabrication for producing metallic components [ 1–8].\\nTitanium alloys are used in several structural applications\\ndue to their lower density, high strength to weight ratio,\\ncorrosion resistance, and elevated temperature properties\\n[9]. Traditionally, titanium alloys are made by vacuum\\ninduction re-melting and carefully controlled thermo-me-\\nchanical processing to tune the microstructure that will\\ndemonstrate satisfactory mechanical properties. Although\\nmanufacturing methods are well established for titanium\\nalloys, the high production cost limits the use of these\\nalloys. Additive manufacturing could provide a means to\\nfabricate parts in titanium alloys at a lower cost. Among\\nthe various grades of titanium alloys, Ti-6Al-4V ( α+β\\nalloy) is the most popular and ﬁnds its applications in\\naerospace, automotive, biomedical, defence and industrial\\nsectors [ 9,10]. The alloy has good weldability character-\\nistics, making it amenable for SLM.&J. J. S.

In SLM, consolidationof metal powder is achieved by melting and solidifying a\\nsmall volume of material in a track-by-track and layer-by-\\nlayer fashion using a high-intensity laser. In other words,the laser beam scans over a layer of powder in a straight\\nline and melts the powder particles under the beam and\\ncreates a small molten pool of metal. As the laser beam\\ntraverses, it leaves a thin track of solidiﬁed metal behind.\\nOn repeating the single track deposit with a well-deﬁnedoverlap (hatch spacing), a layer of cross-section is pro-\\nduced. Upon repeating this layer-by-layer deposition, an\\nentire part is constructed [ 1]. A simple schematic of the\\nSLM process showing track-by-track and layer-by-layer\\ndeposition is presented in Fig. 1[11]. SLM is controlled by\\nvarious processing parameters such as laser power ( P),\\nscanning speed ( v), layer thickness ( t) and hatch spacing\\n(h). These parameters deﬁne energy density of the process\\nas [12]:\\nE¼\\nP\\nv/C2h/C2t: ð1Þ\\nAlthough energy density is a measure of the energy\\ninput to the process, there are other factors such as the\\ncomposition of the metal, atmosphere used, scan pattern,\\nand powder-bed temperature, which also play a signiﬁcantrole [ 13]. All the parameters mentioned above mutually\\ninﬂuence each other, but the degree of effect by each\\nparameter is not well understood. Therefore, studying thebasic element of SLM, i.e., the single-track deposits, will\\nprovide a deeper understanding of the process and could\\nassist in identifying a process window for optimizingparameters, particularly when dealing with new alloy sys-\\ntems [ 11].\\nIn recent times, a great deal of work has been carried out\\non the Ti-6Al-4V alloy for optimization of parameters,\\nmicrostructural characterization, and mechanical property\\nevaluation using SLM [ 12–15]. Gong et al. [ 11] reported a\\nstrategic method to arrive at optimum parameters through\\nproducing single beads on the base plate and extended theirwork to characterize a test pad (10 mm 910 mm 91 mm)\\nwith multiple layers. Gong et al. described the effect of\\npower and scan speed on the melt pool geometry, and also\\nshowed surface topology of multi-layer pads, which wereevaluated for porosity and quality evaluation. However, a\\ndetailed study on porosity and microstructures was not\\nreported. Also, in their study, the single-track deposits weremade on a base plate made on a Ti plate. Very recently,\\nYang et al. [ 16] investigated the role of melt pool on\\nmicrostructure and mechanical properties of Ti-Al-4V. The\\nstudy explores the use of a keyhole mode over a conduction\\nmode for SLM deposits, and it was noticed that the con-duction mode provided denser parts with better mechanical\\nproperties. In their experiments, the single-track deposits\\nwere made on a pure Ti plate. In both the case studies,single-track deposits resulted in a signiﬁcant amount of\\ndilution with the base plate alloy. It is well known that\\ndilution contributes to a change in the local composition ofthe melt pool, thus changing the melting temperature of the\\nTi-6Al-4V alloy powder in the local single-track vicinity.\\nIn other words, the volume of the melt pool created will bedifferent from the actual volume when the melting tem-\\nperature is changed. Hence, the estimate of melt pool size\\nwill probably be close to the actual one but not a truerepresentation of the melt pool size. Therefore, a study on\\nsingle tracks made of the same alloy (Ti-6Al-4V plate) is\\nnecessary to have an accurate measure of melt poolgeometry. Thijis et al. [ 15] studied the inﬂuence of process\\nparameters on porosity and the development of\\nmicrostructures. In their study, they varied the energydensity of the process (by altering the scan speed and hatch\\nspacing) and presented its effects on porosity. They\\ndescribed the evolution of grain (elongated) structure in thedeposits due to epitaxial growth, and the fast cooling in\\nSLM resulting in a fully martensitic phase. The martensite\\nphase formed will experience multiple thermal cyclingeffects during track-by-track and layer-by-layer material\\ndeposition and therefore, ﬁnally result in a microstructure\\ncontaining a hierarchical structure of martensite [ 17].\\nThe quality and the properties of parts produced by SLM\\nprimarily rely on the nature of single-track deposits,\\noverlap between the layers, and thermal history.

We believe that this work will provide\\nfurther insights into understanding the SLM process and\\ncould assist in developing a process window for fasteridentiﬁcation of optimum process parameters.\\n2 Experimental work\\nTi-6Al-4V pre-alloyed powder (15–45 µm) supplied by\\nLPW Technology Inc., Pittsburg, PA, USA, was used in the\\npresent study. The powder was characterized using SEM\\nfor examining the particle size, shape and distribution. AnEOS M270 direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) system\\nwith Yb-ﬁber laser (nominal maximum power 200 W) was\\nused to fabricate the single-track deposits and bulk sampleparts. Experiments were performed with multiple combi-\\nnations of laser power and scan speeds to produce single-\\ntrack deposits and bulk samples (Table 1). A layer thick-\\nness of 30 µm was maintained for all the test samples.\\nWhen a thin wall equivalent to the beam diameter is\\nmade, the laser will scan as one single line, and thus makea single line of deposit. It is known that support structures\\nin an EOS system have a minimum smallest dimension of\\n100µm[18]. Therefore, single-track deposits can be pro-\\nduced utilizing line support structure settings. To achieve a\\nsingle line deposit, thin wall sections with the dimension of\\n0.1 mm 90.1 mm 9100 mm were made using Materialise\\nMagics software and placed at a height of 5 mm. Then\\nsupport structures were generated under these thin wall\\nsections/parts. It is to be noted that these thin walls aresacriﬁcial parts and will be deleted once supports are\\ngenerated. Then parameters (listed in Table 1) with various\\nlaser powers and scan speeds were applied to each of thesingle line supports. A Ti-6Al-4V alloy plate of 3.3 mm\\nwas placed on the build platform, and then a layer of 30 µm\\nthick powder was spread. A single exposure laser scan wasapplied to scan one single layer. In this method, single-track deposits on a Ti-6Al-4V alloy plate (thickness\\n3.3 mm) were made. The single-track deposits were pre-set\\nat 5 mm distance apart. Single-track deposits of a length of\\n100 mm were made on the Ti-6Al-4V plate. A photograph\\nof the plate containing the single-track deposits is shown in\\nFig. 2. The single-track deposits were cut at 1/3, 1/2 and\\n2/3 lengths (sections A, B, and C) for microscopy studies.\\nThe top surface of the single line deposit was examined\\nunder a scanning electron microscope. Later, bulk samples(10 mm 910 mm 95 mm) were built using the same set\\nof parameters. The bulk samples were sectioned, polished,\\nand etched with Keller’s reagent. The bulk samples werecharacterized using optical microscopy for examining the\\nporosity and microstructures. The amount of porosity in the\\nsamples was estimated as per ASTM E-562.\\n3 Results and discussion\\nTi-6Al-4V pre-alloyed powder was characterized usingSEM. Figure 3a shows morphology and distribution of the\\npowder particles. Particle size and distribution were\\ndetermined by measuring the diameters of individual par-\\nticles from several different micrographs. The particleshave a particle size distribution between 15 and 45 μm. The\\npowders showed spherical morphology with bi-modal size\\ndistribution. Figure 3b shows a SEM micrograph revealing\\ncharacteristic micro-dendritic features on the surface of\\npowder particles.

This phenomenon\\noccurs due to the reduction in the energy density as thescan speed was increased according to Eq. 1[10]. The melt\\npool depth was observed to increase signiﬁcantly at lower\\nscan speeds (500 mm/s) and higher power levels particu-larly from 100 W (depth: 45 µm) to 195 W (depth:\\n176µm). The melt pool geometry was observed to have a\\nkeyhole shape for the laser power of 195 W, whereas for100 W it was bowl shape. This remarkable change in melt\\npool shape with laser irradiation can be attributed to key-\\nhole versus conduction modes of melting. For lower laserpower, melting occurs by locally melting the alloy with\\nheat transfer by conduction and convection inside the melt\\npool. In the later case, with a laser power of 195 W,melting of the alloy occurs by keyhole mode, giving rise to\\ndeeper penetration. Keyhole is always associated with\\nvaporization of the alloy and in many cases results inentrapped pores in the melt pool [ 16].

These parameters above when used with\\na well-deﬁned melt pool overlap could provide a window\\nof optimum processing conditions to produce fully denseparts.

The pores formed deep inside, and in the\\nlower end of the melt pool, are more detrimental\\n[9,11,15,19,22]. Therefore, higher power and lower\\nspeed should be avoided for overcoming such adversedefects. The samples made with parameters: (i) 150 W and\\nscan speeds 750 and 1000 mm/s, and (ii) 195 W and scan\\nspeeds 1000 and 1200 mm/s were fully dense.\\nThe energy density gives an estimate of the energy input\\nto the SLM process. Energy density estimation applied in\\nSLM is calculated by using Eq. 1and the values are pre-\\nsented in Table 2. The effect of energy density on the\\nporosity of the samples produced by SLM of Ti-6Al-4V isshown in Fig. 8. The energy densities applied below 50 J/\\nmm\\n3show a signiﬁcant amount of porosity due to insuf-\\nﬁcient melting of the powder particles, which could beconceived from the shape of the porosity and presence of\\nsintered un-melted powder particles. The energy densities\\napplied higher than 66 J/mm\\n3also show some amount of\\nporosity due to higher energy resulting in keyhole effects\\nconﬁrmed by the rounded shape of pores [ 9,11,19,20,22].\\nThe red dotted region in the Fig. 8with the energy density\\nvalues between 50 and 66 J/mm3produced samples near to\\nfull density.As described earlier, in SLM material addition takes\\nplace due to layer-by-layer melting and solidiﬁcation of a\\nthin layer of spread powder. In this process, the laser beam\\nalso re-melts some portion of the layers beneath to ensuregood bonding between the layers. The solidiﬁcation of the\\nalloy begins with the formation of a βnucleus, and the pre-\\nexisting βgrains partially undergo melting and serve as\\nheterogeneous sites for nucleation. Thus, newly formed β\\nwill grow epitaxially in the build direction or opposite to the\\nheat extraction [ 15,23]. In close similarity to the weld\\nsolidiﬁcation, the solidifying βgrains tend to orient towards\\nthe moving heat source (laser beam), resulting in a slightlytilted grain structure. Further, the βgrain orientation in the\\ndeposit highly depends on the laser power, scanning strategy\\nand scan speed applied. They deﬁne the amount of timeavailable for the melt to solidify at any particular instance of\\ntime [ 24]. The solidiﬁed high-temperature β(bcc) phase is\\nunstable at lower temperatures and will transform (belowM\\ns) to a metastable phase, martensitic α′(hcp) phase by a\\nshear-diffusion less reaction since the cooling rates in SLM\\nare high (108–105K/s) [ 17]. Hence, the ﬁnal resultant\\nmicrostructure will have coarse columnar grains, which are\\nhighly oriented towards the build direction with martensite\\nα′inside the grains [ 10,17,25]. Due to the inherent layer-\\nby-layer deposition method, as a new layer is being depos-\\nited a narrow region (heat affected zone) close to the melt\\npool boundary will reach temperatures above the transfor-mation temperature (990 °C), and martensite ( α′)t r a n s f o r m s\\nback to the high-temperature βphase [ 12,17,25]. As the\\nlaser beam traverses away, the high-temperature βphase,\\nunder faster cooling conditions will transform to martensite\\n(α′). The martensite formed from re-heating of primary\\nmartensite ( α′)t oβphase and transformed back to marten-\\nsite will be from here on referred to as α′\\n(secondary) and the\\nheat affected regions (areas colored in blue Fig. 10)r e s u l ti n\\nα´(tertiary) . In other words, as the build progresses, the layers\\nwill experience multiple thermal cycling effects which lead\\nto the formation of alternate areas of martensite α´(primary) ,\\nα´(secondary) andα′(tertiary) in the entire part [ 17].

They are widely employed\\nin automotive, aerospace and aircraft applications because\\nof their recyclability, thermal and electrical conductivity,\\nexcellent strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance,\\nformability, and attractive appearance. In general, most\\ncomponents made in Al alloys are fabricated by tradi-\\ntional manufacturing processes such as casting, forging,\\nextrusion and powder metallurgy. However, the adoption\\nof tooling for making Al alloy parts through these tradi-\\ntional manufacturing routes has much difﬁculty in making\\ncomplex and customized parts, and it also increases the\\ncost of production as well as lead time [ 5]. Therefore,\\nsome novel processing techniques are highly required to\\nobtain complex and functional components with high\\nefﬁciency. Selective laser melting, as a newly developed\\nadditive manufacturing (AM) technique, has become a\\npromising manufacturing route for such business [ 6,7].\\nSLM creates parts by scanning powder particles with a\\nlaser beam so as to melt and fuse the material into a solid.\\nThe parts are manufactured layer-by-layer direct from the\\nCAD ﬁle data, without any part-speciﬁc tools such as\\nmold or dies.

Hence, the elevated densiﬁcation degree could\\neliminate the risk of micro-defects and meanwhile improve\\nremarkably attendant mechanical properties of SLM-pro-\\ncessed AlSi10Mg components. Recently, extensive valu-\\nable studies have focused on the evolution of pores andstrategies to reduce porosity by using variable processing\\nparameters. For instance, Aboulkhair et al. [ 12] have\\nenhanced the relative density of parts being processed (i.e.,minimize the porosity) by design of scan strategies,\\nrevealing that a compromise between parameters and scan\\nstrategies was used to produce high density parts (99.8 %)for AlSi10 Mg alloy. By using X-ray computed tomogra-\\nphy, Maskery et al. [ 13] investigated porosity levels, as\\nwell as pore size and position, and found correlations withthe scanning strategies used to manufacture their speci-\\nmens. They provided us a novel SLM process monitoring\\nmethods (i.e., CT measurements and quantitative defectanalysis) to reﬁne our process parameters. Weingarten\\net al. [ 14] studied the formation mechanism and reduction\\nof hydrogen porosity in AlSi10Mg parts built up withselective laser melting, indicating that the hydrogen\\nporosity can be lowered by efﬁcient drying of the powder\\nas well as by the modiﬁcation of the process parameters.However, all the results from previous researches men-\\ntioned above were obtained by experimental study, ﬁnding\\nout the optical process parameters and strategies but littleunderstanding about the motion of pores within molten\\npool and the mechanism of densiﬁcation.\\nOn the other hand, computational ﬂuid dynamics in\\ncombination with experiments have been performed to\\ninvestigate the inﬂuence of laser scanning speed on the\\nmorphology of porosity in SLM-fabricated components[15]. It showed that the morphology of pores changed from\\nnear-spherical to elongated shape as the laser scan speed\\nincreased. That is to say, laser energy input per unit and theirradiation time by laser beam play crucial roles on the\\ntypes of pores in ﬁnal parts. Qiu et al. [ 16] discussed sur-\\nface structure and porosity of Ti–6Al–4V samples undervarious laser scanning speeds and powder layer thicknesses\\nthrough both experimental and CFD modeling approaches.\\nIt was found that the as-fabricated part was nearly free ofany pores when the applied laser scan speed was decreased\\nbelow 2700 mm/s, while the porosity got increased but not\\nsigniﬁcantly upon laser scan speed further rising up.However, few published CFD models were established to\\nstudy the motion of pores within molten pool and itsinﬂuence on the re-melting process between adjacent lay-\\ners, which is essential to predict the distribution of pores\\nand better understand the densiﬁcation mechanism in\\nlocalized re-melting area.\\nIn the present work, a 3D mesoscopic powder-scale\\nmodel was proposed by using the ﬁnite volume method\\n(FVM), considering the laser absorption mechanism inpowder bed, the powder-to-solid transition, the difference\\nof heat transfer efﬁciency between particles and gas gaps as\\nwell as motion and annihilation mechanism of pores in\\nmolten pool [ 17,18]. The inﬂuences of scanning speed on\\nthe single-track morphology, types of pores and laserpenetration depth have also been discussed. Finally, a full-\\ndense AlSi10Mg component by using appropriate scanning\\nspeed at a ﬁxed laser power could be successfully obtained,without re-melting the same layer twice. Meanwhile, a\\nseries of experiments with different parameters have been\\ncarried out to verify the reliability of the physical model.\\n2 Numerical simulation\\nA multi-phase model presented in the next paragraph wasused to analyze the inﬂuence of scanning speed v[mm/s]\\nand laser energy per unit length [J/mm] on the types of\\npores and relative density during the SLM of Aluminum\\nalloy. In the present model, a simple powder layer ofspheroidal particles irradiated with a Gaussian laser beam\\nwas considered. The scan length was 200 lm. The major\\nsimpliﬁcations of this model are that with respect toabsorption angle dependency, shadowing effects, evapo-\\nration and variation of absorption coefﬁcient are neglected,\\nand an idealized spherical, closely packed powder in reg-ular forms is assumed.\\n2.1 Model establishmentFigure 1a depicts the schematic of thermoﬂuid dynamical\\nmulti-phase model for SLM process. The important phys-ical and chemical metallurgical processes in SLM, inter-\\nactions between laser beam and powder particles,\\nmelting/solidiﬁcation, ﬂuid ﬂow of molten pool [ 19]a s\\nwell as heat transfer mechanism which mainly includes\\nconduction, convection and radiation are all involved in\\nthis physical model.

The shape of volumetric\\nheat source with Gaussian distribution was almost an\\ninverted cone, which is underneath the surface of powderbed. However, this traditional Gaussian heat source just\\nworks well in the macroscopic model, such as regarding the\\npowder bed as a bulk. Slight modiﬁcations about the pro-gram algorithm must be done to adapt our model of particles\\nand gas. As we all know, the laser absorption of gas is pretty\\nlow and can be neglected, so user-deﬁned function was usedto make sure that the heat source only be loaded on the\\nsurface of particles. It should be pointed out that the mod-\\neling was carried out in each gird as a unit. All the grids in\\ncomputational domain were divided into interface grid andinternal grid. A statement was executed in the cone area that\\nGaussian function deﬁned to ﬁnd out whether this grid is\\ninterface gird. Eventually, only the interface grids wereheated; then, the temperature increase in particles is due to\\nthe absorption of surface grids and the thermal conduction\\nfrom external grids to the internal grids. Accordingly, thepowder bed is incompact and porous. That is to say, the\\nabsorption is signiﬁcantly larger than its value for normal\\nincidence on a ﬂat surface [ 23,24]. This is due to multiple\\nreﬂections inside the powder [ 25–27]. Lots of the laser rays\\nthat penetrate the powder are reﬂected back into the powder\\nby the ﬂat surface of preceding layer, resulting in littleenergy dissipation.\\n2.3 Treatments of the initial and boundary\\nconditions\\nAn initial ‘‘guess’’ for the computational domain must be\\ngiven before the CFD simulation.

The\\nmaterial properties required are the thermal conductivity,\\nheat capacity, density and so on. Table 1lists the main\\nproperties of AlSi10Mg, which are used in this simulation. In\\nthe real SLM process, many properties such as thermal\\nconductivity and surface tension are dependent of the tem-perature. Powders are inherently light with poor ﬂow ability\\nand high reﬂectivity along with high thermal conductivity\\nwhen compared to other SLM candidate materials [ 29].\\n3 Experimental procedures\\nThe 99.7 % purity AlSi10Mg powder with spherical shape\\nand an average particle diameter of 30 lm was used in this\\nexperiment. The powder properties were values from thedata sheets of the suppliers. The self-developed SLM sys-\\ntem consisted mainly of an IPG YLR-500-WC ytterbium\\nﬁber laser with a power of *500 W and a spot size of\\n70lm (IPG Laser Gmbh, Germany), a computer process\\ncontrol system, an inert argon gas protection system and an\\nautomatic powder spreading device. The building chamber\\nwas then sealed, and the argon gas with an outlet pressureof 30 millibars was fed inside, decreasing the O\\n2content\\nbelow 10 ppm. The processing parameters used in our\\nexperiments are listed in Table 2. An aluminum alloy\\nblock was ﬁxed on the building platform for the specimens\\nto be built. There are six cubic specimens of5m m 95m m 95 mm, which were built at six different\\nscanning speeds in present experiment. In order to inves-\\ntigate the inﬂuence of scanning speed on morphology ofsingle track, single scan vector was designed at the last\\nlayer. The specimens for metallographic examinations\\nwere cut, ground and polished according to the standardprocedures. The surface morphologies of the fabricated\\nparts were recorded using a Hitachi S-4800 ﬁeld emission\\nscanning electron microscope (FE-SEM).\\n4 Results and discussion\\n4.1 Surface morphologies\\nThe typical simulated surface morphologies of single track\\nwith variable scanning speed are shown in Fig. 2a, with a\\nﬁxed laser power of 100 W. It was apparent that width ofthe single track had a tendency to decrease as high scan-\\nning speed was used. As v increased from 150 to 400 mm/\\ns, the fusion region became narrow due to insufﬁcientliquid spreading to wet the surrounding powder particles.\\nFurthermore, the peak temperature within molten poor and\\nwidth of single track are depicted in Fig. 2b, showing a\\ndownward trend as the vincreases. For instance, at rela-\\ntively lower vof 150 mm/s, nearly three particles along the\\nscanning trace were irradiated and melted to form themolten track, corresponding to the width of 62 lm.

As a result, high laser energy per unit length\\ncorresponding to low scanning speed contributed to sufﬁ-\\ncient melt liquid and high peak temperature in molten pool.This in turn declined the viscosity and surface tension,\\nwhich are both temperature dependent. Flow ability of\\nmelts was apparently enhanced because of low viscosityand low surface tension caused by high work temperature.\\nTherefore, the metallic liquid spread wider and ﬁlled in thegaps between particles more efﬁciently. It is noted that the\\nthermal conductivity of the powder bed is mostly deter-\\nmined by the voids and not sensitive to the properties of the\\nmaterial [ 30]. When the melts ﬁlled up the voids between\\nparticles, the capacity of heat conduction enhanced because\\nthe thermal conductivity of metal is much higher than that\\nof gas.

The geometric appearanceof powder bed at 100 W and 400 mm/s indicated that the\\nparticles slightly melted on the surface while the core of\\nthe particles remained the initial solid state (Fig. 3a). In\\nthis situation, neck formed between adjacent powder par-\\nticles but the liquid phase solidiﬁed rapidly before the neck\\nsize increased. As scanning speed fell to 250 mm/s, theneck size rose noticeably comparing to that in 400 mm/s\\n(Fig. 3c). Nevertheless, the upper-layer particles melted\\nlargely and formed a long continuous sintering line,whereas the underneath particles remained solid state, with\\nsome keyhole pores appearing between the upper and\\nunderneath particles. A full melting occurred with a rela-tively high dense and few pores in the molten pool, as the\\nscanning speed went down further to 150 mm/s.\\nFig. 2 a Simulated surface morphologies from top view by using different processing parameters: v=150 mm/s, v=250 mm/s, v=400 mm/\\ns, (P=100 W). bThe peak temperature and width of single molten track vary with the increase of scan speedTable 2 SLM processing parameters in our experiment\\nParameters Value Unit\\nAmbient temperature, T0 300 K\\nPowder layer thickness, d 60 lm\\ndiameter of laser beam, R070 lm\\nHatch spacing, s 50 lm\\nLaser power, P 100 W\\nScanning speed, v 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400 mm/sInﬂuence of processing parameters on laser penetration depth and melting/re-melting … Page 5 of 12 891\\n123', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The\\nvelocity vector plots show that the motion of the metallic\\nmelts under the laser beam was quite unstable. Figure 3b\\nshows that the melt trace broke up into pieces driven bysurface tension and capillary forces, eventually resulting in\\nopen pore defects. The velocity of melts attached to the\\nparticle surface was 1.43 m/s in maximum and 0.19 m/s inminimum. However, this ﬁgure increased to 2.69 m/s in\\nmaximum and 0.32 m/s in minimum when scanning speed\\ndeclined to 250 mm/s. It is noted that the gas in loosepowder bed had no chance to escape successfully and\\nevolved to pores, causing a low level of density. This was\\nascribed to the fact that insufﬁcient laser power inputcaused by high vled to less liquid phase and larger solid-\\niﬁcation rate. Furthermore, at a relatively lower vof\\n150 mm/s, a complete molten pool appeared and the ﬂowﬁeld depicted a typical radially outward ﬂow pattern, with\\nan elongated shape pore in the center of molten pool. Flow\\nvelocity of ﬂuid (3.24 m/s) on surface was about threetimes of that in the bottom (1.13 m/s).\\nGenerally, at a high scanning speed of 400 mm/s\\n(LEPUL =0.25 J/mm), the supplied heat by laser was\\ninsufﬁcient to melt the whole particles. Only the shell at the\\ngrain border transformed to liquid phase, while the core of\\nthe grain stays unaffected. All the particles were incom-plete bonding just like the liquid-phase sintering where\\npowder was partial melting [ 31,32]. A closer look at theopen pore defect revealed that surface tension drove the\\nmelts on the surface shrinking outward [ 33], and this ﬂuid\\nﬂow made long cylindrical melt track break up into dro-\\nplets (Fig. 3b), which eventually led to the Plateau–Ray-\\nleigh instability [ 34]. However, this instability was\\nalleviated as a lower vwas applied. A full melting of upper\\nparticles can be seen with the vgoing down to 250 mm/s\\n(LEPUL =0.4 J/mm). As a result, many keyhole pores\\nand inverted triangle pores appeared, and this was pri-\\nmarily attributed to the fact that the high thermal conduc-\\ntivity of AlSi10Mg resulted in a quite high solidiﬁcationrate; then, metallic liquid solidiﬁed before it ﬁlled in the\\npores. On the other hand, laser beam could not penetrate\\ninto the depth of powder bed when the upper particlesmelted and formed a long liquid cylinder. As the vde-\\ncreased to 150 mm/s (LEPUL =0.67 J/mm), it was clear\\nthat current layer was completely melted and formed amature molten pool (Fig. 3e, f). The velocity ﬁeld of the\\nmolten pool suggested that the molten pool presented an\\noutward ﬂow character because of the Marangoni effect[35,36]. The temperature gradient led to a surface tension\\ngradient, which caused a Marangoni ﬂow pointed from low\\nsurface tension to high surface tension area on the surfaceof the molten pool. In this situation, the large pores tended\\nto split into several small sphere pores due to the ﬁerce\\nmotion within molten pool. Moreover, it can be inferredthat the Marangoni ﬂow has a crucial inﬂuence on the types\\nof pores and their distributions.\\nFig. 3 Solid fraction of powder\\nlayers showing the formation ofspherical and irregular pores: a,\\nbv=400 mm/s, c,\\ndv=250 mm/s, e,\\nfv=150 mm/s ( P=100 W).\\nThewhite circles at the upper\\npart of each image section\\nindicate the position of the heatsource center891 Page 6 of 12 G.

That is to say, the dimension ofmolten pools was different. As vof 400 mm/s was used\\n(LEDU =0.25 J/mm), the particle in the center of laser\\nspot absorbed the most laser energy and was hardly totransfer heat to ambient environment in such a short time,\\nconsidering the low thermal conductivity of gas gap\\nbetween particles. Then, the shell of particles accumulatedenough energy to reach the melting point and began to\\npartially melt on the surface (Fig. 4a). In this situation, the\\npenetration depth (about 35 lm) was smaller than the\\npowder thickness (50 lm). As a result, the metallurgical\\nbonding between layers was considerably weak and the\\npreceding layer did not re-melt. As the vdecreased to\\n250 mm/s, the melt pool area enlarged with about six\\nparticles melting under the laser irradiation. A relatively\\ndense area was gradually formed since the liquid metalﬁlled in gaps. It should be noted the density in re-melting\\narea was greatly enhanced (Fig. 4b). Moreover, the largest\\nre-melting area and highest working temperature wereobtained at 150 mm/s, which caused the best bonding area\\nbetween current layers and preceding layer. This is to say,\\nthe laser beam penetrated to the preceding layer and the re-melting area enlarged (approximately 81 lm depth),\\ncausing a re-melting densiﬁcation region. Interesting, gas\\nbubbles in preceding layer tended to rose up to currentlayer’s surface under the joint action of buoyancy, ﬂuidﬂow and collapse, resulting in a fully dense layer. Figure 5\\ngives us temperature distribution proﬁles of the molten\\npool along Z-direction. The temperature decreased from\\n1693 K of surface to just above 800 K in 100 lm depth at\\nthevof 400 mm/s, while this ﬁgure showed the same\\ndownward trend at the speed of 250 and 150 mm/s. As the\\ngraph shows, the penetration depth generally increaseswhen the scanning speed falls. It stays 37.3 lm at the speed\\nof 400 mm/s, while this value goes up to 61.8 lm\\n(250 mm/s) and 81 lm (150 mm/s), respectively. There-\\nfore, it can be concluded that low scanning speed allowed\\nthe powder particles to melt completely and increased thepenetration depth of laser beam, which resulted in dense\\ncomponents with good metallurgical bonding between\\nlayers.\\n4.4 Motion of single gaseous bubble\\nTo develop insights into the elimination of porosity and the\\nre-melting densiﬁcation, motion trail of a single bubble and\\nthe velocity plots within the molten pool had been carriedout at the vof 400 mm/s (Fig. 6). When the molten pool\\nthroughout the adjacent layers formed, the gas pore staying\\nin previous layer went up to the current layer, whicheventually made the preceding layer dense. The initial\\nposition of a single gas bubble is shown in Fig. 6aa t\\nt=62ls, and it is clear that the gas bubble that was left in\\npreceding layer began to move up under the up-down\\nconvection within molten pool. Considering the effect of\\nMarangoni ﬂow, the molten pool tended to exhibit a radi-ally outward ﬂow pattern on the surface, while an upward\\nﬂow in the center was observed due to the combination of\\nsurface tension and buoyancy forces.

It is noted thatmost of the bubbles overﬂew from the molten pool or split\\ninto several small round pores during the motion of pool.\\nOnly one typical bubble was monitored to investigate the\\nmechanism of re-melting densiﬁcation.\\nAccording to this simulation result, it is reasonable to\\nconclude that appropriate penetration depth could make\\neach layer become dense after the next layer was pro-cessed. Figure 7gives the schematic of re-melting densi-\\nﬁcation. If the depth of re-melting area ( Dh) is almost equal\\nto half of deposit thickness, full-dense part can be fabri-\\ncated at a high forming rate without re-melting the same\\nlayer twice. It is noted that the last scanned layer, namelythe top layer obviously, would remain relatively high\\nporosity, and melting twice is needed for the top layer.\\n5 Experimental investigations of SLM-\\nmanufactured parts\\nIn order to validate the simulation results that have been\\ndiscussed above, six cubic samples with dimensions of59595m m\\n3were fabricated on aluminum substrate\\nusing various processing parameters.

The penetration depths and binding mechanism were\\npresented with a considerable difference at the variablescanning speeds (ranging from 150 to 400 mm/s). Due\\nto the limitation of irradiated energy, the powder\\nparticles were melt insufﬁciently and the resultantbinding mechanism appeared to be a solid state\\nsintering at high scanning speed. Accordingly, a\\nconsiderable number of large-size open pores couldbe observed in simulations as well as the correspond-\\ning experiments. Additionally, as the scanning speed\\ndecreased from 400 to 150 mm/s, the depths ofpenetration reduced and the attendant pores transited\\nfrom irregular to spherical (metallurgical pores) due to\\na relatively high laser energy density.\\n3. The motion trail of single bubble revealed that the gas\\npores remained in the preceding as-fabricated layer\\ntended to move up to the current layer under the actionof the ﬂuid ﬂow in present molten pool. In this\\nsituation, the accordingly experimental results vali-\\ndated that a numerous number of pores and thecorrespondingly high porosity were evidently observed\\nin the upper layer of SLM-processed parts.\\n4. Re-melting densiﬁcation mechanism was proposed as a\\nnovel approach to eliminate the residual pores. When\\nthe speed of 150 mm/s was applied, the currently\\nfabricated layer was irradiated by the laser beam with arelatively sufﬁcient time and the previous layer had\\nenough time to re-melt. As a relatively high laser\\nenergy density was used, the re-melting depth wasslightly larger than half of the layer thickness, which\\nwas beneﬁt for the residual pores to migrate toward the\\npreviously as-fabricated layer.

The microstructure, microhardness, and wear per-\\nformance of the coatings were studied. The results showed that the coating mainly consists of Ni 3(Al, Ti),\\nCo3Ti and Cr 3Mo. The microstructure of the coating is closely dependent on laser power. Precipitates\\nwere formed in the coating due to these high melting point elements. The highest microhardness of K403\\nsuperalloy coating is 455 HV 0.2, which is 40% higher than that of casted K403 substrate. K403 superalloy\\ncoating also showed a better wear resistance than casted K403 substrate. The wear rate and frictioncoefﬁcient of the K403 coating are only 41% and 70% of those of the casted K403, respectively.\\nFurthermore, the formation of crack was discussed.

It has good chemical and\\nmechanical performance, such as high working temperature,\\ndecent oxidation resistance and thermal corrosion resistance [ 3,4].\\nIt is reported that K403 superalloy can be used in turbine blades\\nbelow 900/C14C and aircraft guide blades below 1000/C14C[5,6]. It is\\nknown that aircraft guide blades are vulnerable to thermal expo-\\nsure and stress damage due to the adverse working condition, and\\nthey are prone to crack and trigger other defects [ 7e9]. Once such\\nblades are damaged, it is dif ﬁcult to repair because of their complex\\nstructure and high precision requirements.\\nLaser Melting Deposition (LMD) has been widely adopted in\\npreparing coatings and repairing parts of refractory metals such as\\ncopper-iron alloy, titanium alloy and tungsten alloy [ 10e13]. It is\\nalso commonly used in nickel-based alloys [ 14,15] additivemanufacturing. Therefore, laser melting deposition is expected to\\nbe a good candidate for K403 blades manufacturing and repairing.\\nExtensive studies have been conducted to improve the proper-\\nties of K403 superalloys, such as elevated temperature and laser\\nshock processing. Liu et al. [ 16] carried out thermal compression\\nand tensile simulating tests on K403 superalloy at different defor-\\nmation temperatures. They found that the fracture mode of K403\\nchanged from quasi-cleavage to inter-granular after reaching\\n900/C14C. Wang et al. [ 17] showed that the surface hardness and re-\\nsidual stress of K403 alloy can be improved after laser surface\\nstrengthening due to the formation of a plastic deformation layer.\\nLiu et al. [ 18] investigated the microstructure evolution of the K403\\nNi-based superalloy under thermal exposure at different temper-\\nature and time, which provided a good understanding on its high\\ntemperature performance. Zhang et al. [ 19] found hot isostatic\\npressing can reduce the casting defects, the stress concentration\\naround the microvoids in polycrystalline, and the plastic defor-\\nmation of the K403 alloy during fatigue test. Li et al. [ 20] laser\\ncladded K403 coatings with different processing parameters and\\nrevealed that reducing the content of B and Si elements can\\npossibly eliminate the generation of crack. Despite the aforemen-\\ntioned studies, little attention has been paid on friction and wear*Corresponding author.\\n**Corresponding author.\\nE-mail addresses: ljbtj@163.com (J.

The experiment was performed in\\nargon atmosphere (oxygen content was less than 50 ppm). The\\ndistance between coaxial powder feeding head and the surface of\\nthe substrate was 15 mm. The ﬂow rate of the powder feeding gas\\n(argon) was 10 L/min and all the powder feeding rate was 25 g/min\\nin this work. The laser power of single-track coating varied from\\n1000 to 3000 W with scanning speed of 400 mm/min. Based on the\\nsingle-track coating results and preliminary testing, 2000 W laser\\npower and 400 mm/min scanning speed was selected for multiple-\\ntrack coating with an overlap ratio of 50%.\\n2.3. Mechanical testing and microstructure characterization\\nThe coating was cut perpendicularly to the scanning direction to\\nprepare metallographic specimens. After grinding and polishing,\\nthe cross-section was subjected to hardness test (HV-1000 microVickers hardness tester) with a load of 0.2 Kg and loading time of\\n10 s.\\nOptical microscope (Leica DVM6A), scanning electron micro-\\nscope (ZEISS Sigma 300, equipped with X-ray energy spectrometer\\n(EDS), accelerating voltage of 15 kV) and metallographic micro-\\nscope (ShanYu CX40) were used to analyze the microstructure,\\nelement distribution, and crack distribution of the coating. The\\ncrystal structures were identi ﬁed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using\\nD/max-2500 X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Cu target, 40 kV, 140 mA).\\nFriction and wear testing were conducted using M /C02000 test\\nblock-ring wear tester. The grinding ring material was GCr15 with\\nhardness of 60 ±2 HRC. The outer diameter of the grinding ring was\\n50 mm with thickness of 10 mm. The size of the specimen was\\n12/C210/C210 mm. The specimen was tested by dry sliding friction at\\nroom temperature with positive load of 150 N; the speed of the\\ngrinding ring was 300 r/min and the wear time was 60 min. Worn\\nspecimens were scanned by Phase Shift MicroXAM-3D to obtain\\nthe morphology of worn marks.\\n3. Results and discussion\\n3.1. Overall macroscopic and microscopic features3.1.1. Macroscopic morphology\\nFig. 2 a shows the macrostructure of the single-track coatings\\nprepared with different powers by laser melting deposition of K403\\npowder on casted K403 substrate. The coating width increases with\\nthe laser power as the molten pool increases [ 21]. By depositing\\nmultiple single-track close to each other, continuous and uniform\\nﬁlm with metallic luster can be formed, as displayed in Fig. 2 b.\\nMulti-layer coating can make the ﬁlm thicker and more uniform.\\n3.1.2. Microstructure\\nThe schematic of the coating shown in Fig. 3 a indicates all the\\nmeasurement for analysis. Based on the cross section of K403\\ncoating illustrated in Fig. 3 , the measured melting depth and the\\nheight characteristics of the single-track coating are plotted in\\nFig. 4 . Generally, with the increase of laser power, the coating\\nwidth, height and melting depth almost increase linearly [ 22].\\nFig. 3 bef shows that most of the cracks initiated from the heat-\\naffected zone, perpendicular to the coating/substrate interface,\\nand gradually developed to the top of the coating (details will be\\ndiscussed later).\\nFig. 5 shows the cross section of multi-track single-layer and\\ndouble-layer coating. Both are compact and smooth. The boundary\\nbetween the coating and the substrate is obvious (as indicated bywhite dash line), and there are obvious overlapping marks. The\\nheight of single-layer coating and double-layer coating are about\\n1.5 and 3.6 mm, respectively. Scattered short cracks are observed in\\nthe middle and bottom of the single-layer coating along the grain\\nboundary. These cracks are caused by anisotropic contraction re-\\nsults from the different crystal structure or lattice parameter [ 21\\n].\\nIn the double-layer coating, the pre-formed cracks elongate and\\nfurther grow, penetrating from the coating-substrate interface to\\nthe coating surface. Such long crack is formed at the joining loca-\\ntion of two tracks, which is due to the high accumulated residual\\nstress during the solidi ﬁcation and thermal contraction [ 21].\\n Fig. 1.

Planar, cellular,\\ncolumnar dendritic and equiaxed dendritic crystals are sequentially\\nformed as the degree of supercooling increases or the decrease of\\nG/R values [ 21,26]. In the melting zone of substrate, the tempera-\\nture gradient ( G) in front of the solid-liquid interface is very large\\nand the extent of constitutional supercooling is small. Thus, the\\nmolten metal near the bonding line tends to form planar crystal and\\ngrows up from the bottom of the molten pool [ 27], as indicated in\\nFig. 6 d. With the increase of the distance from the bonding line, the\\ntemperature gradient decreases. Thus, the solid/liquid interface of\\nthe planar crystal becomes unstable when constitutional super-\\ncooling is greater than the front solidi ﬁcation speed, resulting in\\nthe transition of planar crystal to cellular crystals and dendrites\\n[28]. In the top area (as shown in Fig. 6 c), heat can be transferred to\\nmultiple directions in the surrounding environment, and solidi ﬁ-\\ncation speed is large, therefore the microstructure is mainly\\nconstituted of equiaxed grains and dendrites. Such crystal distri-\\nbution was also reported by Wang et al. during LMD of titanium\\nalloy components [ 29]. From the point of crystallization, large\\nplanar and cellular grains result from the epitaxial grain growth\\nfrom the pre-existed grains at the substrate, while ﬁne equiaxed\\ngrains are newly nucleated near the surface.3.2.2. Effect of laser power on the single-track coating\\nmicrostructure\\nFig. 7 a and b shows that there are many columnar dendritic\\ncrystals in the bottom area of the coating when laser power is no\\nmore than 1500 W. Increasing the laser power to 2000 W, a small\\namount of equiaxed crystals appear ( Fig. 7 c). Further increase the\\npower to 2500 W, uniform columnar dendritic crystals are formed\\nat the bottom of the coating ( Fig. 7 d). Even higher power of 3000 W\\n(Fig. 7 e) coarsens the cellular crystals from 5.3 mm (at 1000 W) to\\n10.2mm. With the increase of laser power, the value of GR (namely\\ncooling rate) decrease, which explains that the dimension of\\ncellular crystals increases with the increasing of laser power [ 21].\\nMicrostructures of the middle area of the coatings at different\\nlaser powers are shown in Fig. 8 . When the power is 1000 W,\\ncolumnar dendritic crystals are produced in the middle area of the\\ncoating. A large number of equiaxed crystals are produced when\\nthe power is 2000 W. When the power is 2500 and 3000 W, the\\ncolumnar dendritic crystals dominate the characterized area.\\nSimilar as the bottom area, with the increase of laser power, the\\ngrain size also increases; for instance, the crystal grain size in-creases from 6.5\\nmm to 8.3 mm as the laser power increases from\\n2500 W to 3000 W. All the ﬁve cases show that crystals tend to\\ngrow upwards, which is aligned with heat ﬂow direction. Such\\nFig. 5.

According to the EDS results, the ratio of Cr and Mo\\natoms is 3:1 in the area 3. It is reported that Mo, Cr can form Cr 3Mo\\ncompounds at high temperatures [ 33]. Therefore, the ﬂocculent\\nprecipitate of area 3 is inferred to be Cr 3Mo.\\nAs W has the highest melting point (so as well the highest so-\\nlidiﬁcation temperature) among the constitutional elements, it\\ntends to be the condensation center during cooling. The Ti and Mo,\\nsurrounding the W gradually condense into high temperature\\nprecipitates. Precipitates are produced in the middle area of the\\ncoating, where no dendrites are observed. In the bottom of the\\ncoating, obvious equiaxed crystals are observed without any pre-\\ncipitates. The precipitate is formed by segregation of elements.\\nTemperature plays an important role in atom diffusion and crys-\\ntallization [ 34e36]. A different temperature gradient between the\\nmiddle and the bottom of the coating leads to a different atomic\\ndiffusion ﬂux (J) during the heating process of the material. Here, J\\ncan be expressed by the following equation [ 37]:\\nJ¼pMbD 1\\nð1/C0nÞkT(5)\\nwhere Mis the shear modulus, bis the Berthner vector, Dlis the\\nintragranular diffusion coef ﬁcient, nis the Poisson's ratio, kis the\\nBoltzmann constant, and Tis the absolute temperature.

(7)that the atomic diffusion ﬂux ( J)\\nalmost increases exponentially with the increase of temperature\\n(T). The high temperature caused by the high energy load greatly\\npromotes the diffusion of tungsten atoms, as well as the nucleation\\nrate and eventually forms ﬁne precipitates.\\nThe temperature in the middle of the coating is high and the\\ncooling rate is low, which facilitates the diffusion of elements. TheTi, Mo, and W elements in the molten pool are uniformly diffused.\\nAfter the formation of the nuclei, Mo and Ti elements aggregate and\\nform precipitates. The bottom temperature of the coating is low,\\nand the cooling rate is high, so W, Mo, Ti cannot be diffused and\\nsegregation occurs at the bottom of the coating. Therefore, den-\\ndrites are formed under the rapid condensation in the bottom area\\nof the coating without a large amount of precipitates. Double-layer\\ncoating is prepared on the basis of single-layer coating. Compared\\nto the double-layer coating, the single-layer coating has a low\\nsubstrate temperature and a high heat transfer rate, so the tem-\\nperature ( T) is also low. It can be seen from Eq.

Crack analysis\\nIn order to gain insight of crack formation, a clear crack observed\\nin the LMD in single-track coating using 2000 W is analyzed. As\\nshown in Fig. 15 a, the cracks initiate from the heat-affected zone\\n(HAZ) and gradually develop towards the top of the coating. A high\\nmagni ﬁcation image of the crack, as indicated by dotted line in\\nFig. 15 b, is a typical solidi ﬁcation cracking, which grows along the\\nedge of the dendrite (or grain boundary) and penetrates the\\ndeposited layer. As shown in Fig. 15 b, the left side of the crack are\\nequiaxed crystals with relatively uniform distribution while uneven\\ncolumnar dendritic crystals are formed on the right side. The crystal\\ngrowth directions on both sides of the crack are also different,\\nwhich are related to the favorable growth direction of local grain\\nand the heat ﬂow direction. It is believed that the anisotropic\\ncontraction due to the different crystal structure or lattice param-\\neter can lead to the solidi ﬁcation cracking in this case [ 21].\\nOn the other hand, due to the high cooling rate during laser\\nmelting deposition, and the solidi ﬁcation of the molten pool can be\\nconsidered as a typical non-equilibrium solidi ﬁcation. The\\ncompositional elements of K403 superalloy are very different,including high melting point elements of W and Mo, and low\\nmelting point elements of Al and Ti. Therefore, during solidi ﬁcation,\\nW and Mo crystallize ﬁrst as the temperature decreases; then Al\\nand Ti tend to wrap outside of the crystallized W and Mo parts,\\nwhich working as nucleus. Due to the fast solidi ﬁcation process, the\\nmolten compositions cannot diffuse completely, leading to the\\nnonuniform distribution of each component in the crystal grain.\\nCorrespondingly, before complete solidi ﬁcation, the lique ﬁedﬁlm\\n(low melting point elements) is formed between the grain\\nboundaries [ 45], and the liquid phase itself has a small deformation\\nresistance. Due to the complex microstructure, the residual liquid\\nphase between the grain boundaries is not free to ﬂow and\\nreplenish. Consequently, the concentration of tensile stress on the\\nliqueﬁedﬁlm causes cracking, which is located between the grain\\nboundaries. Such phenomenon was also reported by Xu et al. in\\nlaser solid forming of IN-738LC superalloy [ 44]. It is believed that\\npreheating in combination of proper laser processing parameters\\ncan alleviate the cracking in the future for LMD of K403.\\n3.6. Microhardness\\nIn this section, microhardness of the coating was evaluated.\\n2000 W laser power and 400 mm/min scanning speed was selected\\nfor single-layer and double-layer coating. As shown in Fig. 16 a, the\\nhardness of the single-layer coating is higher than that of the\\ndouble-layer coating and the casted K403 by about 21.62% and\\n38.46%, respectively, with variation between 425 and 525 HV\\n0.2.\\nThis can be explained by the fast cooling during laser meltingdeposition compared with casted K403 substrate, which re ﬁnes the\\ngrain (as shown in Fig. 6 c). According to the Hall-Petch relationship,\\nin certain range hardness decreases with the increase of grain size\\n[46]. Therefore, laser melting deposition can enhance the hardness\\nof K403. During the deposition of the second layer, however, the\\nﬁrst layer is re-melted and ﬁne grains are coalesced to form large\\ngrains [ 47]. Meanwhile, due to the pre-heating of the ﬁrst layer,\\nduring the coating of the second layer, the cooling rate decreases\\nsigniﬁcantly, which also contribute to the grain growth [ 21]. Large\\ngrains consequently cause the decrease of hardness in the double-\\nlayer coating compared with the single-layer coating [ 48].Fig. 16 b\\nshows the in ﬂuence of laser power on the microhardness of K403\\nsingle-track coating. It shows clearly that the coated K403 is harder\\nthan the casted K403 substrate. Overall, the microhardness ﬁrst\\nincreases, and then decreases with the increase of laser power. The\\nlow microhardness at low laser power is probably due to low laser\\nenergy results in a low nucleation rate in recrystallization, and high\\nhardness precipitate consisted of W, Mo, Ti is not formed. As the\\nlaser power increases, the microhardness increases because more\\nprecipitate is formed as the nucleation rate in recrystallization in-\\ncreases. However, when the power reaches 3000 W, the micro-hardness decreases. This is because grain size increases\\nsigniﬁcantly with the decrease of solidi ﬁcation rate, leading to the\\nlowest hardness [ 49,50].\\n3.7. Wear properties\\nFinally, the wear performance of the coating was characterized\\nand compared with casted K403 substrate. Fig. 17 shows the change\\nof friction coef ﬁcient and wear rate of K403 single-layer coating,\\ndouble-layer coating and casted K403 substrate as a function of\\nsliding cycle. The maximum friction coef ﬁcient is 0.36 resulting\\nfrom casted K403. Compared with the substrate, the average fric-\\ntion coef ﬁcient of single- and double-layer coatings decreases to\\n0.268 and 0.251. The friction coef ﬁcient curves of the three\\nmeasured samples are smooth without signi ﬁcant ﬂuctuation.\\nCompared with the casted K403 substrate, both friction and wear\\ncharacteristics of single-layer coating and double-layer coating are\\nimproved.\\nIn the early stage of friction and wear test, the friction coef ﬁcient\\nof single-layer coating rises at ﬁrst and then decreases gradually,\\nwhile the double-layer coating decreases ﬁrstly and then rises\\nrapidly. As show in Fig. 17 a, with the friction time increases, the\\nfriction coef ﬁcients tend to stabilize. The friction coef ﬁ\\ncient curve\\nof three samples can be divided into two stages: wearing-in stage\\nand stable wearing stage. At the beginning of sliding between\\nfriction pairs, the interfacial ﬁlm will be abraded and the cold-\\nwelding effect occurs in the contact point. Thus, a high shear\\nforce is needed to cut the “welded ”point and subsequently the\\nFig. 15. (a) SEM image of the overall crack. (b) Zoom in of the crack.H.

Since the grains in single-layer coating are denser than the\\ntwo-layer coating, the cold-welding effect is aggravated and the\\nfriction coef ﬁcient is increased in the wear stage. In the stable wear\\nphase, the K403 coating undergoes abrasive wear process,in which\\nthe particles worn off from friction pairs act as abrasive, thus lower\\nfriction coef ﬁcients are observed. As the temperature increases due\\nto the friction, the particle wear of the friction pair is more easily\\ncold-welded and transferred between the friction pairs. Therefore,\\nthe adhesive wear mechanism dominates in the later stage of the\\ntest [ 51].\\nAs shown in Fig. 17 b, the calculated wear rate of casted K403,\\nsingle-layer coating, and double-layer coating are about 0.039,\\n0.028, and 0.016 respectively; among which the double-layer\\ncoating shows the smallest value. In addition, the surface of K403\\ncoating has smaller friction coef ﬁcient and smaller wear rate than\\nthat of the casted K403, and its wear resistance has been greatly\\nimproved. The friction coef ﬁcient curve also indicates that the wear\\nresistance of K403 coatings are better than that of casted K403, and\\nthe double-layer coating is better than the single-layer coating.\\nFig. 18 shows the morphology of the worn surface before and\\nafter dry sliding wear. Compared with the case before the wear test\\n(Fig. 18 aec), a large number of spalling pits and ploughing groove\\nappear on the worn surface, as show in Fig. 18 def. The wear degreefor K403 coating is signi ﬁcantly lower than that of casted K403\\nsubstrate. The Debris is pushed into the spalling pit and some\\nsheet-like materials appear on the worn surfaces of the coatings\\n(Fig. 18 heg). Such phenomena indicate that adhesive wear and\\npeeling wear occurred during the wear process [ 52].\\nIn the initial stage of the dry sliding wear, the contact part be-\\ntween the ring and the sample ﬁrst experiences adhesive wear\\nunder the friction force. Due to the friction between the coating and\\nthe ring, debris falls from the surfaces of ring and coating (mostly\\nfrom the sample surface, and a small amount from the rings). When\\nthe debris is produced, the debris will be mixed into the friction\\npair during the testing process, which changes the friction interface\\nfrom the friction between the ring and the coating to the friction\\namong the ring, the coating and the debris. During the friction,\\nabrasive wear occurs on the contact surface, which produces the\\nmetal plastic deformation and ploughing grooves [ 53]. As the\\nfriction time increases, the friction work continues to increase the\\nfriction surface temperature, eventually forming a micro-cuttingmechanism. Due to the micro-cutting mechanism under the ac-\\ntion of friction, fragmentation and spalling occurred on the friction\\nsurface.\\nAfter dry sliding wear, the wear marks on the surfaces are\\nshown in Fig. 19 .

Introduction\\nMetal additive manufacturing technology is attractive with unique\\napplications in various industries for replacement or customized parts\\nwith complex geometries and structures [11,12,27] . As a metal additive\\nmanufacturing process, laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) or tradition-ally known as selective laser melting process is favorable in obtaining\\nfully dense structures without a need for post processing [9,21] . Many\\nresearch studies have been reported on its applications, processimprovement and parameter optimization [35,36,38,43] and numerical\\nmodeling to predict the temperature ﬁeld, melting and evaporation\\n([13,14,29,30,37,40]) and microstructure analysis and prediction\\n[2,41,42] . However, L-PBF process requires relatively high energy\\ndensity levels and lower scan velocities to successfully melt and fuse the\\npowder metal material when compared to laser sintering processes[15,25]. Due to high energy intensities applied with the high powerlaser beam, there may be meltpool instabilities, issues related to\\nmaterial spattering and balling, rapid material evaporation and keyhole\\neﬀects [34,38]. Resultant built part quality, structural integrity and\\nresidual stresses [6,24] is also a major concern especially for additively\\nmanufactured parts in nickel alloy 718 or nickel alloy 625 that areconsidered for deployment in mission critical components in aerospace\\napplications. After all these research studies, the in ﬂuence of L-PBF\\nprocess parameters on the quality measures such as density andprocess signatures such as meltpool shape and size is still not fully\\nunderstood.\\nIn literature, the overwhelmingly exploited quality measure is the\\ndensity of the ﬁnal part in addition to surface roughness and dimen-\\nsional tolerances [16– 18,24] . Meltpool geometry is also widely studied\\ndue to being a determinant of density and surface roughness [18,23].\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2017.03.004\\nReceived 21 September 2016; Accepted 15 March 2017☆Oﬃcial contribution of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); not subject to copyright in the United States.

On the other hand, large\\nmeltpools may yield vaporization of the substrate and causes pores in\\nthe structure that increase porosity [26]. To assure a stable meltpool,\\nthe meltpool dimensions are not allowed be too small or too large inorder to avoid irregularities or droplets [24].O ’Regan et al. [28]\\nclassiﬁes the parameters a ﬀecting such measures under four groups:\\nfeedstock, build environment, laser, and meltpool. Most of these\\nparameters are prede ﬁned, that is, their values have to be adjusted\\nbefore processing and some are controllable, that is, their values can bechanged during processing. Lastly, some criteria are classi ﬁed as\\nundeﬁned, that is, their values depend on other parameter adjust-\\nments. Control and optimization over L-PBF systems are achieved by\\nchanging prede ﬁned and controllable parameters. Even though laser\\npower, scan velocity, hatch distance, and layer thickness have beenknown to be the most important parameters through experimentations,\\ntheir relative importance are statistically analyzed in the recent study of\\nKamath [17]. According to this study, scan velocity is the most\\nimportant parameters. A higher scan velocity causes the interactionbetween material and the laser beam to be short, which results in a\\nnarrow meltpool which also leads to rough surfaces, whereas decreas-\\ning the scan velocity causes excessive heating and vaporization. A very\\nhigh scan velocity causes instability and droplet formation due to free\\ncylindrical meltpool geometry. A very low scan velocity yields distortion\\nand irregularities due to balling e ﬀect[18]. A low scan velocity is\\nknown to ensure a dense structure with the cost of rough surface.Hence, the optimal scan velocity is a trade-o ﬀbetween resultant\\ndensity and surface quality [24].\\nCriales et al. [7]analyzed the e ﬀects of varying laser power, scan\\nvelocity, and the packing density of the powder material for selectivelaser melting of nickel alloy Inconel 625 using ﬁnite element simula-\\ntions. A sensitivity analysis has been conducted to investigate theinﬂuence of material properties and process parameters on the\\npredicted temperature pro ﬁle along the center of the laser beam path.\\nThey found that the packing density (or porosity) signi ﬁcantly a ﬀects\\nthe temperature pro ﬁle. The powder re ﬂectivity has the greatest e ﬀect\\non the predicted peak temperature and melts pool geometry, followedby laser power and scanning speed. In a recent study, Arisoy et al. [5]\\ninvestigated L-PBF of nearly fully dense nickel alloy 625. Theyobserved that L-PBF generates a microstructure through directional\\nsolidiﬁcation that can be controlled by scan strategies and selection of\\nprocess parameters. They provided experimental investigations onmicrostructure formation including sizes of cellular grains and growth\\ndirections of columnar grains on the test coupons. They analyzed the\\nmain e ﬀects\\nof process parameters including laser power, scan velocity,\\nhatch distance, and scan strategy that produce various solidi ﬁcation\\ncooling rates and thermal gradients during the process, which also\\ncontributed to understanding of the resultant microstructure.\\n2. Laser powder bed fusion of nickel alloy 625\\nLaser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is an additive manufacturing\\nprocess that enables direct fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) parts\\nfrom computer models by scanning regions of a powder bed using a\\nhigh energy laser beam that selectively melts and fuses cross-sectional\\ngeometry on each layer followed by subsequent solidi ﬁcation according\\nto active ASTM terminology [1]. In L-PBF, the powder material is\\ncompletely melted and solidi ﬁed with an aim to achieve fully dense\\nparts. A traditional L-PBF set-up typically requires a high power lasersource ( Fig. 1 ). Some of the key advantages of L-PBF over other\\nmanufacturing techniques include: (i) high ﬂexibility in manufacturing\\ncomplex shapes, (ii) quick process setup avoiding the need for tooling,and (iii) broad choice of materials including high strength superalloys.\\nThese advantages allow for quick transition between manufacturing\\nproducts of di ﬀerent geometries within the same station.\\nThe most attractive feature of L-PBF is the ability to use thisprocess to produce highly complex geometries and structures that\\nwould normally not even be feasible using conventional production\\ntechniques. However, L-PBF has several major disadvantages: the laser\\nheating process is known for its rapid heating times and unpredictable\\ncooling times, which result in high localized residual stress, nonhomo-\\ngeneous and anisotropic microstructure and material properties, as\\nwell as the formation of gas pores and voids in the microstructure,\\nwhich often lead to reduced material density and mechanical properties\\nsuch as strength, hardness, toughness, and fatigue resistance. Other\\nthan common concern of lack of fusion or gas induced porosity, dealing\\nwith structural defects such as residual stress, delamination, cracking\\nare major challenges in L-PBF. The scan strategy, process temperature,\\npowder mixture, build chamber atmosphere and many other inputs\\ndetermine the occurrence and quantity of such defects [33].\\nIn L-PBF, laser characteristics, process parameters, and material\\nproperties must be studied jointly to obtain a better understanding of\\nthe laser processing of powder metal materials. Laser characteristics\\nare unique to the laser equipment such as maximum power, wave-\\nlength, beam spot diameter (or size), and beam energy distribution and\\nusually cannot be modi ﬁed by the end user. However, L-PBF involves a\\nset of processing parameters that can be modi ﬁed such as laser power\\n(P), scan velocity ( v\\ns), hatch distance ( h), stripe width ( w), and layer\\nthickness ( s) as shown in Fig. 2 and scan strategy rotation ( SSR)a s\\nshown in Fig. 3 .\\nIn the L-PBF process, consecutive layers are built by processing\\npowder material with a pre-speci ﬁed powder layer thickness. These\\nconsecutive layers are processed slightly di ﬀerently to ensure a robust\\nbuild. More speci ﬁcally, stripe orientation changes from layer to layer\\nby a set margin. Two scan strategies available are a) 90° counterclockwise rotation, and b) 67° counter clockwise rotation between\\nconsecutive layers. Fig. 3 illustrates this concept for both of these laser\\nscan strategies.\\nIn L-PBF, the laser beam spot diameter is considered ﬁxed (e.g.,\\nd=100 µm) with uniform or near Gaussian beam energy distribution,\\nbut laser power, scan velocity, hatch distance, and layer thickness canbe altered to a desired energy density setting, which a ﬀect the resultant\\nmelt pool geometry, heat a ﬀected area, quality of fusion, cooling rate,\\nformation of solidi ﬁcation microstructure on the powder bed. The\\neﬀects of these process parameter settings together with powder\\nmaterial characteristics on the variations of the resultant part quality\\nin terms of density, material properties, dimensional quality, surface\\nroughness, and defects are not well understood.\\n3. Experimental design\\nAn EOS M270\\n1Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) machine was\\nutilized for processing of experimental test coupons. This machine has\\na single-mode, continuous wave (CW) ytterbium ﬁber laser with\\nmaximum power of 200 W. An adequate quantity of commercialadditive manufacturing grade nickel alloy 625 powder produced by\\ngas atomized process with the average particle size of 35 µm was used\\nand solid coupons in the shape of cubes (16 mm×16 mm×15 mm) weremanufactured using an EOS M270 DMLS machine under nitrogen gas\\nambience at the National Institute for Standards & Technology (NIST)\\nfacility located in Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA.

There\\nwere two limitations that restricted experimental design selection: i) a\\nmaximum of 36 test coupons could be fabricated due to size constraints\\nin the build platform of the L-PBF machine, and ii) hatch distance\\ncould only be increased or decreased in intervals of 0.01 mm. The ﬁrst\\nlimitation eliminated the possibility of a three-level factorial design forthree factors and two scan strategies, which would require a minimum\\nof 54 treatments. The second limitation greatly reduced the applic-\\nability of Box-Wilson central composite design types [32], which\\nrequire high resolution in between levels. Therefore, machine roundingerror while input of process settings would have signi ﬁcantly altered\\nthe outcome of Box-Wilson type designs. Another alternative, the Box-Behnken design, o ﬀered an advantage by requiring comparatively\\nfewer number of runs while maintaining rotatability. The Box-Behnken design for three factors is based on considering processparameter combinations at the midpoints of the edges of the process\\nspace cube, as well as at the center. Therefore, three levels of each\\nfactor are considered. These low, medium, and high levels for each\\nfactor are de ﬁned as: P=169 W, 182 W, and 195 W, v\\ns=725 mm/s,\\n800 mm/s, and 875 mm/s, and h=0.09 mm, 0.10 mm, and 0.11 mm.\\nAdditionally, we de ﬁne energy density as the amount of energy applied\\nto the powder bed per unit volume. Energy density is then a function oflaser power ( P), scan velocity ( v\\ns), hatch distance ( h), and layer\\nthickness ( s), as given in Eq. (1).\\nEP\\nvh s=∙∙s (1)\\nThe range for each factor was selected so that resulting energy\\ndensity for all sets fell within the calculated limits [3]that showed\\nacceptable builds. Three additional coupons were built at the “default\\nsettings ”for control purposes. The powder layer thickness is kept\\nconstant at s=20 µm.\\nThe test coupons fabricated using these parameter settings are\\n16 mm×16 mm at the base, and 15 mm in height. The ﬁnal height of\\nthe coupons is less than 15 mm, as wire electrical discharge machining\\n(w-EDM) is used to separate the built coupons from the platform, and\\nsome of the coupon remains attached to the platform. 16 mm was\\nselected as the width and length of the coupons so that each processedlayer of powder is composed of four 4-mm wide stripes. Stripe overlap,\\ndeﬁned as the area of material in which laser scanning overlaps by\\nconsecutive stripes, is 0.1 mm. Therefore, total stripe width is 4.1 mm.Atﬁrst, a set of 18 coupons were fabricated using 90° rotation in\\nscanning direction (stripe orientation) between layers. A second set ofcoupons, following the same experimental design as the ﬁrst set, was\\nprocessed using the default scanning rotation (stripe orientation)setting of the L-PBF machine, which is estimated to be an approxi-\\nmately 67° rotation.\\nFig. 1.

Measurement of relative density\\nBoth sets of coupons, built with 90° and 67° scanning rotation\\nbetween layers, were measured for size and mass to determine the\\ndensity of each coupon.

Measurement and analysis of melt pool marks\\nMelt pool marks can be analyzed to determine important informa-\\ntion regarding melt pool geometry. Melt pool geometry data is\\nclassiﬁed into two types: melt pool dimensions (width/depth) and melt\\npool shape.\\n5.1. Measurement of melt pool width and depth\\nMelt pool width and depth can be measured via digital optical\\nmicroscopy (DOM) of the planes that allow a cross-sectional view of the\\nmelt pool, i.e., XZ and YZ. However, it should be noted that there is\\ndiﬃculty in measuring melt pool marks using microscope images\\nespecially with the depth measurements on multi-layer parts. It iscertain that the subsequent layer will re-melt some of the recently\\nprocessed layer, likely obscuring some of the melt pool marks andincreasing uncertainty in these depth measurements. Nevertheless,\\nimages were taken using a progressive scan digital microscope\\nequipped with CMOS image sensor. Image size is 1600 (H) pix-\\nels×1200 (V) pixels. The length of the melt pool at any speci ﬁc time\\ncannot be measured due to the continuous nature of the laser scanningprocess. Therefore, one single continuous track can be observed in the\\nx-direction, as shown in Fig. 4 a. Due to the 90° scanning strategy\\nbetween layers, XZ and YZ become interchangeable when analyzingmelt pool dimension. Melt pool width and depth can be measured every\\nother layer due to the change in orientation of the scanning direction,\\nwhich allows a view of the cross-section of the melt pool every other\\nlayer ( Fig. 4 b). It should be noted that the images given in Fig. 4 are\\nused in explaining the processing of tracks and layers in L-PBF andthey are not used in taking measurements of melt pool dimensions.\\nIn order to obtain images where the melt pools could be measured,\\nthree of the coupon faces corresponding to XY-, XZ-, and YZ-plane,\\nwere electro-polished a total of 50 µm deep. Therefore, melt pool\\nmeasurements were taken at a cross-section very close to the edge of\\nthe coupon (see Fig. 5 ).\\nNote that points A, B, and C will represent consecutive melt pools\\nobserved in an image taken of the YZ-plane. The distance between A-B\\nand B-C is the same, and equivalent to one hatch distance. However,\\nthere is a discrepancy between the time necessary for the laser to arrive\\nat point B from point A, and the time required to reach point C from\\npoint B. Assuming that the laser o ﬀ-time between hatches is 0.042 ms\\nmeasured during coupon building using a high speed camera at 24,000frames/s, and the scan velocity is 800 mm/s for a 4 mm stripe width, it\\nfollows that:\\ntw\\nv≈2=2(4 mm)\\n800 mm/s=1 0m s AB(3)\\nt laser off time≈ = 0. 042 m s BC (4)\\nTherefore, it takes approximately 10 ms longer for the laser to reach\\nthe same x-coordinate location on consecutive hatches, depending on\\nwhether this particular location of interest constitutes the beginning orthe end of a scanned hatch. This di ﬀerence in time is considerable,\\nbecause it allows the local powder material to cool about 10 ms and hasan eﬀect on the melt pool dimensions, as shown next.\\nTwo di ﬀerent sizes of melt pools were observed due to the\\ncharacteristics of the laser scanning process described previously: i) a\\nType I melt pool, where the area being processed (points A and C in\\nFigs. 5 and6) is still within the heat-a ﬀected zone of the previous hatch\\nscanning, and ii) a type II melt pool, where the area currently beingprocessed (location B in Figs. 5 and6) is no longer a ﬀected by the heat\\nfrom the laser scanning of the previous hatch or track.\\nType I and Type II melt pools can be formally de ﬁned as follows: in\\nan YZ-plane at a speci ﬁcx-location ( xisﬁxed), the time elapsed\\nbetween two consecutive passes of the laser footprint through this\\nplane will vary as a function of x. For locations very close to the stripe\\nboundaries, the di ﬀerence in time elapsed is the largest. This leads to\\ndiﬀerent sized melt-pools along this particular YZ-plane. The size of the\\nmelt pool will depend on the scanning direction. Melt pools at alocation at the beginning of the stripe will be larger (Type I) and melt\\npools at a location at the end of a processed stripe will be smaller (Type\\nII). The di ﬀerence in melt pool sizes can be attributed to the presence\\nof a heat-a ﬀected zone (HAZ) and rapid cooling times. Digital optical\\nmicroscopy imaging and thermal camera imaging were used to\\ncorroborate these results.\\nA digital optical microscope was utilized to obtain images of the\\nelectro-polished surfaces from which the melt pool width and depth\\nwere measured. All the images utilized for analysis were captured in1600 pixel×1200 pixel resolution and 500× magni ﬁcation.

Melt pool shape analysis\\nThe laser heating e ﬀect described in the previous section produces a\\nnotable e ﬀect on the geometrical shape of the melt pool as well. In\\nparticular, by analyzing the images obtained via digital optical micro-\\nscopy, it was observed that the location along the y-axis at which the\\nmaximum melting depth occurs does not necessarily lie on the hatch(or track) centerline. To quantify this e ﬀect, a measure of the melt pool\\nshape was developed and will be explained next.\\nFor this analysis, we will consider once again the cross-sectional\\n(YZ-plane) view of the melt pool. The melt pool width, w, and the\\ndistance from the edge of the melt pool farther away from the previous\\nhatch to the location at which the maximum melted depth is observed,\\na, are measured using the same methodology as before (see Fig. 8 a).\\nThen, a measure for the melt pool shape is de ﬁned as follows:\\nφa waw\\nwaw\\nw(, ) =−/ 2\\n/2=2−\\n(5)\\nWith this de ﬁnition, a way to determine how skewed the melt pool\\nis has been established. If the melt pool is perfectly symmetrical about\\nthez-axis, then a=w/2 and φ=0, or 0%. On the contrary, if the meltpool is completely skewed towards the previous processed hatch due to\\nthe heat-a ﬀected zone, then a→w/2, in which case φ→1, or 100%. In\\nsummary, this measure gives a value between 0 and 1 (or 0% and100%) that quanti ﬁes how asymmetrical the melt pool geometry is. To\\nfurther illustrate how this measure is employed, consider the followingexample taken from the digital optical image microscopy obtained of\\nCoupon 29, previously shown in Fig. 6 . In this example we consider\\nonly a single melt pool. Note that wandahave been measured in pixels\\nand have not been converted to micrometers to avoid rounding error(see Fig. 8 b).\\nThe melt pool shape can then be determined using Eq. (4):\\nφ(242, 346) =242−346/2\\n346/2= 0. 3988 = 39.88%(5)\\nThis value of φclose to 40% indicates that the melt pool is\\nconsiderably asymmetrical, indicating a strong e ﬀect of the already-\\nprocessed scanned hatch (or track). By repeating this process for all\\nmelt pools previously measured, it is possible to obtain an average\\nmeasure (and standard deviation) of the melt pool shape for a speci ﬁc\\nset of process parameters. Then, the melt pool shape measure fordiﬀerent process parameters can be tabulated and presented for\\ncomparison, as shown in Table 3 . It should be noted that at least 30\\nmeasurement samples for each melt pool type per coupon were\\ncollected. The main conclusion from this analysis is that beyond the\\nvariation in melt pool shape between processing conditions, Type I and\\nFig. 7.

Eﬀect of process parameters on melt pool size and shape\\nThe eﬀects of L-PBF process parameters such as laser power, scan\\nvelocity, and hatch distance on the melt pool geometry has beeninvestigated.\\n6.1. E ﬀect of process parameters on melt pool width and depth\\nThe e ﬀect of process parameters on melt pool dimensions (width\\nand depth) can be analyzed via main e ﬀect plots, as shown in Figs. 9 –\\n11. Melt pool size increases with increasing laser power and decreasing\\nscan velocity. However, the behavior is clearly non-linear. Additionally,the melt pool width and depth measurements taken indicate that there\\nis a large di ﬀerence between Type I and Type II melt pool width\\n(approx. 50 µm). This is in contrast with the di ﬀerence between Type I\\nand Type II melt pool depth, which does not appear to vary signi ﬁ-\\ncantly (approx. 10 µm). Melt pool width and depth decrease withincreasing hatch distance, especially for Type I melt pools. This is in\\nagreement with what is intuitively expected, since a larger hatch\\ndistance causes the heat a ﬀected zone from a previously scanned track\\nto be further away from the following track. Additionally, the di ﬀerence\\nin depth between Type I and Type II melt pools is greatly reduced with\\nincreasing hatch distance.\\nAnother way to analyze these results is to consider the behavior of\\nmelt pool depth and width as a function of laser energy density, as\\nshown in Figs. 12 and 13 . The trend lines show that melt pool size\\nincreases slightly as energy density increases. This behavior is more\\nnoticeable in melt pool depth than in melt pool width. Furthermore,\\nthere is no appreciable di ﬀerence in behavior between Type I and Type\\nII melt pool size when considering energy density as an all-inclusivefactor. In summary, the measurements taken for melt pool width and\\ndepth give very signi ﬁcant insight into the dynamic nature of melt pool\\nsize. Furthermore, the change in melt pool size is non-linear.\\n6.2. E ﬀect of process parameters on melt pool shape\\nThe e ﬀect of processing parameters on melt pool shape can be\\nrepresented via main e ﬀect plots, as seen in Figs. 14 –16. Notice the\\nconsiderable e ﬀect of low hatch distance in Type I melt pools and of\\nhigh laser power in Type II melt pools. Melt pool shape tends to be\\nmore asymmetric with increasing laser power and increasing scan\\nvelocity, especially for Type II melt pools. However, the behavior is\\nclearly non-linear. Melt pool shape measurements taken indicate that\\nthere is a considerable di ﬀerence between Type I and Type II melt pool\\nshapes. Type I melt pools are considerably more asymmetric than TypeII melt pools. This behavior is more easily observable at lower scan\\nvelocities. Notice that Type I melt pools tend to be more symmetric\\nwhen the highest level of hatch distance is utilized.

Recall\\nthat energy density is a function of laser power, scan velocity, layer\\nthickness, and hatch distance. Fig. 17 shows a plot of melt pool shape,\\nby type, as a function of energy density.\\nThe trend line on Fig. 17 shows that melt pool shape is more\\nasymmetrical as energy density increases. This behavior is more\\nnoticeable in Type I melt pool than in Type II melt pools. In summary,\\nthe di ﬀerence in melt pool shape for Type I and Type II melt pools can\\nbe mostly attributed to the e ﬀect of the heat-a ﬀected zone from the\\nprevious scanned track. Therefore, hatch distance is the most relevant\\nfactor, as hypothesized initially.\\n7. In-situ thermal monitoring\\nIn-situ monitoring of the process using two-color pyrometer\\nthermal camera [10] and thermography ( [20]) can be utilized to\\nquantitatively analyze melt pool size and investigate spattering phe-\\nnomenon [34]. Video recordings of the process can be utilized if a\\ncamera is placed in the L-PBF process chamber. Due to the nature ofthe process, i.e., a laser beam moving at very high speeds, a high frame\\nrate (HFR) camera is required. An HFR infrared camera has been setup\\nto observe a portion of the build area of an L-PBF machine at the\\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) facility in\\nGaithersburg, MD, and the process has been recorded for a test coupon\\n(Coupon 35) fabricated using P=195 W, v\\ns=800 mm/s, and\\nh=0.10 mm.\\nThis section presents investigations on the melt pool size and\\nspattering analyses of the process using the HFR thermal camerarecording. There are some di ﬃculties in processing of these images.\\nTheﬁnite dynamic range of the camera means much of the data is at\\nthe noise ﬂoor outside the melt pool, or saturated due to the high\\ntemperatures within the melt pool. The spattering particles that occupythe same area as the melt pool in the image frame (e.g., particles that\\nare immediately above the melt pool) are not all recoverable from theimages as they may also saturate the camera and appear to coincidewith the saturated melt pool. In addition, a visible lens glare (or\\nghosting) creates an erroneously increased temperature measurement\\nwhich a ﬀects relative uncertainty at low temperature values.\\nFurthermore, the speed, path, and frequency of spatter particles arenot always captured since the spatter frequency is at or above the\\ncamera frame rate. Additionally, solidi ﬁed and powder regions have\\nlocally variant emissivity values, which e ﬀectively cause spatially\\nvariant and ‘noisy’ temperature measurements. However, for simpli-\\ncity, a single emissivity value is assumed, which is likely the largest\\ncontributor to temperature measurement uncertainty.\\n7.1. Experimental set-up for thermal camera\\nThe thermal camera properties are shown in Table 4 . The camera\\nhas an integration time of 0.040 ms and can record at 1800 frames per\\nsecond, which translates to 0.5555 ms per frame. In the instantaneous\\nﬁeld of view (iFoV), each pixel represents 36 µm. Thermal video and\\nprocess parameters are shown in Table 5 . The video recording of the\\ntest coupon has 801 total frames. The processing occurs out of the view\\nof the camera for 99 frames. Horizontal scanning is recorded for 602\\nframes with approximately 60 tracks, and a vertical scanning of the\\nstripe boundary is recorded for 100 frames. Since each track is\\nprocessed for 5.125 ms (calculated from track length divided by scan\\nvelocity), the camera records approximately 9.23 frames per track. The\\nnon-integer number means that the frequency of the process is\\ndiﬀerent than what the camera records, therefore the initial and ﬁnal\\npoint of each track are not necessarily recorded with the camera. It isalso important to note that some frames during processing are missing\\nin the recording, i.e., skipping occurs.\\nMoreover, as shown in Fig. 17 , the camera is placed at a 43.7° angle\\nwith the powder bed. Recording at this angle causes the image of the\\nbuild plane surface in the ydirection to appear smaller than the actual\\nsize. Each pixel represents a 36 µm horizontal instantaneous ﬁeld of\\nview (iFoV), however, due to the recording angle, the iFoV size,\\nprojected onto the build plane, is corrected in the ydirection with\\nFig. 10.

Melt pool size analysis\\nIt is possible to infer changes in the sizes of melt pools from the\\nthermal camera recording by observing the size of the measurableisotherms surrounding the actual liquid melt pool. Each frame can be\\nprocessed individually such that pixels with temperatures exceeding\\nthe liquidus temperature (1350 °C for nickel alloy 625) are segmented\\nfrom colder pixels. Fig. 18 shows the result of image segmentation\\nusing liquidus temperature as a threshold on single frame where themolten region is marked red, and colder region is marked blue. Using\\nMatlab's built-in functions, a bounding box is created around the melt\\npool such that the height of the box gives the width of the melt pool in\\npixels. This process is repeated for 185 di ﬀerent frames that belong to\\n20 diﬀerent tracks. During the processing of melt pool size calculations,\\nit is observed that some of the spattering particles that are in close\\nproximity to the melt pool a ﬀect the melt pool size calculation\\nalgorithm. For simplicity, we refer to these particles as attachedparticles. Fig. 19 shows these attached particles and how they may\\naﬀect the melt pool size calculation.

Spattering analysis\\nSpattering is a common but potentially detrimental phenomenon\\nthat is observed during L-PBF. When the laser beam hits an area, local\\nevaporation of the melt pool cause some of the molten metal to eject\\nfrom the melt pool, or surrounding heated particles to be blown away\\nby the strong local convective ﬂow, and land on other areas [19]. These\\nparticles are often observed to move in opposite direction of the laserbeam and they may a ﬀect the melt pool behavior during processing. It\\nis possible to determine the sizes and temperatures of the spattering\\nparticles from the HFR thermal video recording.\\nSpattering particles are originating from the vicinity of the melt\\npool; therefore they have high temperatures and thus appear as bright\\nclusters of pixels. Each frame of the thermal video recording is\\npreprocessed in order to improve the quality of the particle count\\nand size measurements. One of the biggest problems is the existence ofthe lens glare around the melt pool region. This not only creates\\ndiﬃculties in particle detection, but also creates spurious temperature\\nﬁelds. In order to remedy this, a lens glare ﬁlter is implemented in the\\nregion close to the melt pool. Images obtained from the red channel are\\nﬁrst converted to grayscale images. Afterwards, a threshold based on\\npixel color density is implemented to segregate the image into black\\nand white areas such that the lens glare region as well as the melt pool\\ninside it are grouped together, and are separated from the lower densityregions. Then, pixels in this region are divided into multiple bins based\\non their intensities and the median density of all bins that belong to the\\nlens glare –melt pool regions are calculated and subtracted from this\\nregion. It is important to note that a tradeo ﬀis necessary between the\\ncomplete removal of the lens glare and preserving particle information,\\nand rather conservative values are used in this study. As the next step\\nin particle detection, another density based thresholding is employed to\\nreveal the pixels at a certain temperature range, followed by median\\nﬁltering to reduce noise. The resulting image is then processed to count\\nthe number of pixels in each particle that represent the area of each\\nparticle. These areas, in units of pixels, are then converted to\\nmillimeters using the iFoV sizes calculated for the camera, disregarding\\nFig. 19.

Heating and cooling rates\\nThe thermal camera images can be utilized to quantify the heating\\nand cooling rates. By sampling the temperature data at certain points,\\nthe rate of cooling and heating can be estimated. Although absolute\\ntemperature measurements are a ﬀected by multiple potential sources\\nof uncertainty previously mentioned, these create systematic biaserrors, therefore di ﬀerential measurements (like heating or cooling\\nrate), may cancel a signi ﬁcant portion of this error. At this point, it is\\nimportant to note that due to the asynchrony between the frequency oftrack processing and the recording rate of the camera, the x-coordi-\\nnates of melt pools do not align across tracks. Theoretically, there can\\nbe up to\\n=410 μ m4.1 mm\\n10diﬀerence in melt pool x-coordinates between\\ndiﬀerent tracks, considering that each track takes at most 10 frames to\\nbe processed. This causes an inconsistency in temperature measure-\\nments between tracks, when analyzed individually. In order to alleviatethis, the temperature histories for certain tracks are shifted temporally\\n( ± 1 frame) as a post processing operation in an attempt to create an\\nagreement with the rest of the tracks. Furthermore, multiple tracks are\\nused in the analysis and an average temperature history is constructed.\\nOut of the 20 tracks analyzed, 10 of them have a positive scanning\\ndirection (laser moves in the + xdirection) while the other 10 have a\\nnegative scanning direction. These two groups of tracks are analyzedseparately.\\nAt each frame from the thermal camera data, the centroid of the\\nmelt pool is calculated. Each track's center in y-coordinate is identi ﬁed\\nusing the mean of melt pool centroids that are observed in that track.These y-coordinates are used in the following analysis. Temperature\\nmeasurements at various x-coordinates (the beginning, middle, and\\nend of the track) are recorded during the timeframe of the processing of\\neach track (up to a maximum of 10 frames), at the respective track\\ncenters in y-coordinates. It is important to note that spattering\\nparticles, if positioned on top of the sampling points, can a ﬀect the\\nresult of this analysis.\\nFig. 23 shows the minimum, maximum and mean temperatures\\nobserved at three di ﬀerent xlocations: the beginning, middle and the\\nend of the track, for the tracks with positive scanning directions.

Conclusions\\nIn this paper, a complete and thorough analysis of coupons\\nadditively fabricated using laser powder bed fusion (selective laser\\nmelting) of nickel alloy 625 powder has been presented. A methodology\\nwas de ﬁned and applied to analyze a set of test coupons, following a\\nBox-Behnken experimental design. These coupons were analyzed withtwo objectives in mind: i) to determine how close each coupon was to\\nfully dense and ii) to determine melt pool dimensions (width, and\\ndepth) and shape for each coupon. The main conclusion of this paper is\\nthe identi ﬁcation and de ﬁnition of a dynamic melt pool, a condition\\nwhich indicates that melt pool geometry is constantly changing as thelaser scans a single track. Speciﬁcally, two di ﬀerent types of melt pools\\n(i.e. Type I and Type II) have been identi ﬁed from the process analysis.\\nWhen the laser beam begins to process a new track that is still within\\nthe heat-a ﬀected zone of the previous scanning, the melt pool is named\\nType I and the width is the largest and the shape is highly skewedtowards the heat-a ﬀected zone. As laser processing of the track reaches\\nto the end of the track so called Type II melt pool becomes normal inshape and smallest in width. This is a unique observation that the melt\\npool size and shape changes dynamically leading to some new process\\nknowledge in LPBF. The presence of melt pools of varying size may\\nprove key in future research for microstructure characterization and\\nthe calculation of mechanical properties of additively manufactured\\nparts.\\nIn order to gain in-depth understanding of the laser fusion\\nprocessing of powder material, an in-situ thermal camera video\\nrecording is performed and analyzed for meltpool size, spattering\\nparticles and heating and cooling rates during processing of nickelalloy 625 powder material. From in-situ thermal video imaging\\nanalysis, signi ﬁcant powder particle spatter has been observed with\\nabout 20 –35% of the total area being processed spattered along a single\\ntrack leading to substantial powder material and heat loss. During high\\nenergy density laser processing of nickel alloy 625 powder material, a\\nrapid heating from about 600 –800 °C temperature to 1200 –1400 °C\\nwith a heating rate of 600 °C/ms towards the scanning direction andcooling from the peak process temperature to 600 °C with a rate of\\n150 °C/ms have been measured. These measured heating and cooling\\nrates provide new in-depth process understanding and can be used in\\nvalidating LPBF simulation models for prediction of thermal ﬁeld and\\nsolidiﬁcation microstructure.\\nAcknowledgement\\nThis\\nproject was supported by the National Institute of Standards\\nand Technology, United States Department of Commerce, under the\\nﬁnancial assistance number 70NANB14H227.References\\n[1]ASTM ISO / ASTM52900-15, Standard Terminology for Additive Manufacturing –\\nGeneral Principles –Terminology, ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA,\\n2015 .\\n[2]K.N.

A cost-effective, near-net shape, laserforming approach to producing large andcomplex parts has been developed and isbeing commercialized.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThe excellent combination of specific\\nmechanical properties (i.e., normalizedto density) exhibited by titanium alloyssuch as Ti-6Al-4V are very attractive foraerospace applications.\\n1–3 However, the\\nhigh cost of the final components, result-ing from the high cost of producing rawtitanium and processing and machiningdifficulties combined with buy-to-flyratios that average 5:1 and can often begreater than 20:1, result in titanium be-ing used only when it is the only mate-rial that can meet design requirements.There is generally a direct relationshipbetween material cost and volume ofuse; consumption decreases with increas-ing cost. Thus, any process that can re-duce the cost of titanium components isattractive to the aerospace industry.\\nOne such process is the near-net shape\\nLasform\\nSM process4–8 being commercial-\\nized by the AeroMet Corpora-tion of Eden Prairie, Minnesota.This process, shown schemati-cally in Figure 1, is a laser addi-tive manufacturing (LAM) pro-cess that combines high-powerlaser cladding technology withadvanced rapid prototyping todirectly manufacture complex,fully dense, three-dimensionalcomponents directly from com-puter-aided design images. Theprocess fabricates shapes fromtitanium powder and targetplates and is performed withoutthe cost of molds or dies. Themajor advantages of Lasformingare near-net shape components,dramatically reduced deliverytimes, greatly reduced machin-ing requirements, enhanced de-sign flexibility, the ability to pro-duce grade chemistries, repaircapability of broken or worncomponents, feature addition ca-Producing Titanium Aerospace\\nComponents from Powder UsingLaser Forming\\nF.G.

The programdemonstrated the viability of rapidprototyping of titanium-alloy parts andthe production of cost-effective compo-nents very close to net shape (requiringonly a final machining operation) withchemistry, microstructure, and mechani-cal properties meeting stringent aero-space requirements.\\nMTS Systems Corporation designed\\nand fabricated the full-scale commercialLasform system currently located atAeroMet’s Eden Prairie facility (Figure2). The system is being operated in col-laboration with the U.S. Army ResearchLaboratory’s Aberdeen Proving Ground,Maryland, as part of a three-year coop-erative research and development agree-ment program to further develop, evalu-ate, and validate the Lasform process fordefense applications in a semi-commer-cial mode. Independent investor re-sources have supported the continueddevelopment of the process to the pointof full commercialization.\\nTHE LASFORMING PROCESS\\nA schematic of the process is shown\\nin Figure 1, in which titanium powderis fed in a controlled fashion to theworkpiece, where it is melted by the CO\\n2laser, progressively building up a struc-ture one layer at a time. Thus, for ex-ample, complex ribs and flanges can bebuilt up on a starting plate, dramaticallydecreasing material loss (to machinechips). Typical laser-formed structuresare designed to be 0.762–5.08 mm over-size. These built-up structures can beangled as much as 60 ° from the vertical.\\nThe deposition rate can be controlledbased on heat-balance effects, so thatmetallurgically sound interfaces areformed between each fused powderlayer. Normally, fully dense parts areproduced at a deposition rate of 0.90–4.5\\nkg per hour. Typical lasformedparts after final machining areshown in Figure 3.\\nAt least four types of precur-\\nsor titanium powders\\n9,10 have\\nbeen successfully used to date,all in the –40 +325 mesh range:blended elemental (commer-cially pure titanium powder plusAl/V master alloy), gas-atom-ized, plasma-rotating electrodeprocessed, and hydride-dehydride prealloyed powder.Good flow characteristics to theworkpiece are required. Alloysproduced include Ti-6Al-4V, Ti-5Al-2.5Sn, Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-2Mo-0.1Si, and Ti-6Al-2Sn-2Zr-2Cr-2Mo-0.25Si.\\nThe major advantage of the\\nLasform process is producingcomplex, laser-formed, near-netshapes (referred to as machiningpreforms) requiring only finalmachining and heat treatment.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The current AeroMet Corporation/ARL Lasform commercial-scale system.\\nFigure 3. Typical lasformed and machined components.\\nConventionally, these parts are produced\\nby forging, which requires expensivetooling and extensive machining or ahog-out from a large slab or plate of hot-rolled material. The cost for relativelyshort production runs (up to 500 parts)is decreased, and design changes once aproduction run is underway can beachieved much easier. Delivery timesare about 30–60 days as compared to asmuch as 15 months for the forge plusmachine approach.\\nPost-laser-forming part inspection in-\\ncludes coordinate measuring machineverification of the dimensions, witnesssamples for mechanical property test-ing, and chemical analysis as well asultrasonic inspection and x-ray radiog-raphy. After final machining, die-pen-etrant inspection can also be carried out.\\nThe Lasform process can also be used\\nas a feature addition technique in whichlugs or extensions are added to forgings,castings, or extrusions. This allows sim-pler and economical dies and tools to beused and provides more efficient mate-rial utilization. There is also the possibil-ity of repairing broken, mismachined, orworn sections of a component.\\nLASFORMED COMPONENT\\nCHARACTERISTICS\\nThe microstructure of lasformed Ti-\\n6Al-4V consists of relatively fine priorbeta grains that are about the same sizeas those in thin casting. These prior betagrains, which can be columnar or equi-axed, depending on the laser-systemforming perameters used, transformduring cooling to produce relatively thinand discontinuous grain-boundary al-pha and transgranular alpha (Figure 4).The mechanical properties of las-\\nformed Ti-6Al-4V (post laser-form subbeta transus anneal and age) include839 MPa yield strength, 900 MPa ulti-mate tensile strength, 12.3% elongation,a 23.5% reduction in area, and 104 MPa\\n  m KIC. As would be expected,1–3 these\\nare equivalent to the mechanical proper-\\nties typical of Ti-6Al-4V cast and wrought(ingot metallurgy) material.\\nThe integrity of the lasformed parts\\nproduced has been found to be as goodas or better than that of cast and wroughtproducts, and these latter are not typi-cally 100% defect free. For example, thepowder-metallurgy approach to produc-ing components from superalloys andtitanium for demanding applicationssuffers from at least the perception thatdefects that will degrade mechanicalproperties can be present. Hence, eventhough superalloy Rene 95 parts havenever exhibited a problem in T700 heli-copter engine parts, near-net shapes arenot allowed; instead, a quality-assur-ance forging step is included in final partfabrication.\\nFatigue initiation properties are very\\nsensitive to the presence of inclusions.Thus, the data shown in Figure 5 arevery encouraging. Here, the smooth S-Nfatigue data for lasformed Ti-6Al-4V areat the high end of cast data, albeit thelower portion of the cast and wroughtscatterband.\\n1–3 This is probably at the\\nlower end of the ingot data because ofthe nature of the microstructure of thelasformed material. A finer, more equi-axed microstructure would raise the datatoward the upper part of the cast andwrought scatterband. More recent datashow this improved S-N performance .\\nTHE NEXT STEP\\nThe current AeroMet/Army Research\\nLaboratory production system is oper-ating at 18–19 kW and allows parts 2.5 mlong × 1 m wide × 1 m in height (up to\\nnine tonnes in weight) to be producedwith ±0.076 cm reproducibility.

Under an Office ofNaval Research Dual Use Science andTechnology program, four wing compo-nents for the F/A-18E/F will be fabri-cated using laser forming—the innerwing-splice fittings and the wing-foldfittings.\\n12 Based on a purchase of 400\\naircraft, a cost savings of $50 million isestimated. The prime contractors, Boeingand Northrop-Grumman, estimate thatlaser forming will result in a 75% reduc-tion in delivery time and more thanthan 20% cost savings.\\nThe project’s near-term thrust is toproduce titanium parts for full compo-nent testing, demonstrating cost savingsand reduced delivery times at mechani-cal property levels equivalent to castand wrought levels. Production ordersare expected to follow. In the future,new concepts will be explored, such asbuilt-up structures (unitized structureseliminating fasteners) and structureswith functionally graded compositions(e.g., a disc with optimized low-cyclefatigue behavior in bore areas and maxi-mized creep performance in the rim lo-cations). The lasforming of componentsfrom other base materials, such as nio-bium, rhenium, inconel, and stainlesssteel, is also planned.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nAeroMet/MTS Systems have made out-\\nstanding progress in the last few years incommercializing this new process.

First, calibration coupons were built using IN625, Ti64 and Fe powders and a\\nspeciﬁc LPBF system. These coupons were manufactured using the predetermined ranges of laser\\npower, scanning speed, hatching space, and layer thickness, and their densities were measured using\\nconventional material characterization techniques. Next, a simpliﬁed melt pool model was used to\\ncalculate the melt pool dimensions for the selected sets of printing parameters. Both sets of data were\\nthen combined to predict the density of printed parts. This approach was additionally validated\\nusing the literature data on AlSi10Mg and 316L alloys, thus demonstrating that it can reliably be used\\nto optimize the laser powder bed metal fusion process.\\nKeywords: additive manufacturing; laser powder bed fusion; process optimization; analytical model\\n1. Introduction\\nInterest in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing (AM) has spiked in many\\nindustries, creating a high demand for new AM-ready metallic materials [ 1]. However, the mechanical\\nproperties, surface ﬁnish, and precision of LPBF parts are dependent on more than 60 processing\\nparameters [ 2], which all need to be optimized. There are currently two main ways to realize this\\nprocess optimization for new alloys. Most often, this optimization is carried out by deﬁning an\\nexperiment plan that covers different arrangements of laser power, scanning speed, hatching space,\\nlayer thickness, scanning strategy and part orientation for a given alloy [ 3–10]. Once the specimens are\\nprinted, their mechanical properties are evaluated and a conclusion is drawn on the inﬂuence of the\\ndifferent processing parameters on the ﬁnal part geometric and service attributes. This approach yields\\nsatisfying results, but requires multiple printing jobs and time-consuming post-processing experiments.\\nIt could easily be realized for a single alloy, but becomes prohibitively expensive if multiple process\\noptimization campaigns are required.\\nAnother way a new AM material can be introduced is by applying a numerical modeling approach\\nwith the objective of ﬁnding the appropriate printing parameters, as shown in [ 11–15]. However,\\ndue to a large number of variables, these models require signiﬁcant time and computer resources\\nto model a single laser track, let alone a complex part. Moreover, the more complex the model,\\nthe more laborious the calibration procedure, which makes the process optimization more cumbersome\\nand labor-intensive.\\nIn this work, we investigate the possibility of using a combination of a simpliﬁed analytical model\\nof the melt pool and of an experimental calibration routine to create a density control algorithm for the\\nJ.

Conclusions\\nA simpliﬁed analytical model of the LPBF process was used to develop the density prediction\\nalgorithm for a given powder feedstock and a given LPBF system. Using a set of density calibration\\ncoupons built with the laser power varying from 160 to 350 W; the scanning speed, from 500 to\\n2800 mm/s; the hatching space, from 30 to 550 µm, and the layer thickness, from 30 to 60 µm, this model\\nwas adapted for the IN625 alloy powder and an M280 EOS LPBF system. This approach was then\\nvalidated for different alloys and processing conditions using literature data, thus demonstrating its\\npotential for the LPBF process optimization. It was also shown that the layer thickness value has a direct\\ninﬂuence on the creation of the processing map and must be taken into account during the calibration', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The cooling time during powder delivery is taken into account to si-mulate the actual production process well. It shows obviously the existence of heat accumulation effect\\nin SLM process and, the tailored set of cooling time of 10 ms during powder delivery alleviates that\\neffectively. The maximum temperature gradient in the molten pool slightly increases from 1.30 /C210\\n4°C/\\nmm to 2.60 /C2104°C/mm as the laser power is increased from 75 W to 150 W. However, it is negligibly\\nsensitive to the variation of scan speed. There is a positive corresponding relationship between the\\nmaximum rate of temperature change and processing parameters. A low laser power (75 W) or a highscan speed (300 mm/s) is more energy ef ﬁcient in Z-direction of the molten pool, giving rise to a deep-\\nnarrow cross section of the pool. Whereas, a high laser power (150 W) or a low scan speed (50 mm/s)\\ncauses a shallow-wide cross section of the molten pool, meaning it is more energy ef ﬁcient in the\\nY-direction of the melt. The combination of a laser power of 125 W and a scan speed of 100 mm/scontributes to achieve a sound metallurgical bonding between the neighbor layers and tracks, due to the\\nproper molten pool size (width: 109.3 mm; length: 120.7 mm; depth: 67.8 mm). The SLM experiments on\\nTiC/Inconel 718 powder system are performed to verify the reliability and accuracy of the physical modeland, simulation results are proved to be correct.\\n&2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\\nNickel-based superalloys are widely used as high-temperature\\nservice parts in industrial and aerospace ﬁelds in which perfect\\ncombination of elevated temperature workability and mechanical\\nproperties are required [1]. Inconel 718, the typical representative\\nof nickel-based superalloys, due to its outstanding oxidation re-sistance, hot corrosion resistance and fatigue resistance, has been\\nrecognized as the most promising candidate for many applications\\nsuch as turbine wheel blades, rocket motors, nuclear reactors andfossil fuel components at elevated temperature [2]. Furthermore,\\nInconel 718 based metal matrix composites (MMCs), reinforced\\nwith discontinuous TiC reinforcements, show the superioritycompared with the pure parts for signi ﬁcantly increased not only\\nof strength and hardness, but also of elasticity modulus and wearresistance, amplifying effectively the serviceable range of Inconel\\n718[3]. However, the poor wetting ability between the reinforcing\\nparticles and the matrix extremely reduces the particle/matrix\\ninterfacial bonding due to the formation of microcracks or pores,\\nthus resulting in the premature failure of MMCs during mechan-\\nical loading [4]. Considerable research efforts are required to study\\nthe liquid wetting effect of powder particles for alleviating the\\npores and microcracks between the particle/matrix interface and,\\nthus, improving their bonding ability. Meanwhile, the conven-\\ntional manufacturing processes, such as casting process, easily\\ncause the grain coarsening and shrinkage cavity/porosity and, they\\nare dif ﬁcult to manufacture Inconel 718 composites with complex\\ngeometry [5]. These put forward new requirements on the mate-\\nrial forming techniques.\\nSelective laser melting (SLM), as one of the most important\\nbranches of additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, exhibits a\\ngreat potential for direct fabricating 3D parts with ﬂexibility in\\nmaterials and shapes [6–9].

Fully dense parts are created\\nby a laser beam with a high intensity in a special scanning strategy,\\nlocal melting and subsequent solidi ﬁcation of the powder bed in\\nsuccessive layers [10]. As the laser beam is scattered through the\\npowder bed, the energy is absorbed by powder particles via both\\npowder-coupling and bulk-coupling mechanisms [11]. The powder\\nsystem experiences a rapid cooling rate (up to 106–7°C/s) during\\nthe interaction between the powder particles and the laser beam,\\nwhich has a substantial effect on the generation of ﬁne and uni-\\nform microstructure, as well as resultant mechanical properties of\\nﬁnal components [12,13]. The materials in SLM process have a\\ntendency to experience a signi ﬁcant non-equilibrium physical and\\nchemical metallurgical process, exhibiting multiple modes of heat,\\nmass and momentum transfer [14]. The typical defects associated\\nwith SLM such as “balling effect ”, residual porosity, stress induced\\nmicrocracks, warpage induced dimensional accuracy and delami-\\nnation tend to occur under inappropriate processing parameters\\n(laser power and scan speed) [15,16]. Therefore, to obtain the\\ndesired SLM-fabricated parts, the signi ﬁcant research efforts are\\nrequired to study the relationship between processing parameters\\nand melting/solidi ﬁcation mechanism. However, the experimental\\nmeasurements of thermal-physical statistics during SLM process\\nare considered to be dif ﬁcult for it involves the fast moving of laser\\nenergy source, the limited liquid lifetime of the molten pool and\\nthe extremely high cooling rate of the elevated-temperature melt.\\nConsequently, the numerical simulation approach is typically\\nchosen as an alternative to solve the problems mentioned above.\\nIn fact, some heat conduction three-dimensional models have\\nbeen established to investigate the thermal behavior and further\\nmelting/solidi ﬁcation mechanism during SLM process recently.\\nGusarov et al. [17] simulated and analyzed the temperature dis-\\ntribution of steel 316 L powder bed during SLM process. The\\nanalysis of the capillary stability of the segmental cylinder applied\\nto the calculated melt pool estimated the stability of the process\\ndepending on the scanning velocity, powder layer thickness, and\\nthe material optical and thermal properties in the developed\\nmodel. The results showed that the thermal-physical phenomenon\\nwas highly dependent on the processing parameters (laser power,\\nscan speed, thickness of powder layer, properties of materials,etc.). Roberts et al. [18] proposed a three dimensional thermal\\nmodel for fabrication of TiAl6V4 parts, considering the tempera-\\nture-dependent thermal-physical properties, which is bene ﬁcial to\\nimprove the computational accuracy. This model involving mul-\\ntiple layers was equally of great importance because the thermal\\ninteractions of successive layers affected the temperature gra-dients, which governed the heat transfer and thermal stress de-\\nvelopment mechanisms. The work predicted the transient tem-\\nperature distribution during the production. It was found that the\\nlaser region experienced rapid thermal cycles accompanied with\\ncommensurate stress cycles. Ali Foroozmehr et al. [19] conducted\\ntheﬁnite element simulation of steel 316 L SLM process con-\\nsidering optical penetration depth and, each calculating step is\\ndivided into some smaller sub-steps where the change in the\\nmaterials properties from “powder ”to “solid ”occurred for im-\\nproving calculation precision. They paid attention to the in ﬂuences\\nof the different scan speeds on the melt pool depth, width, and\\nlength. It suggested that the melt pool size varied from the be-\\nginning of a track to its end and from the ﬁrst track to the next\\none. The melt pool size, however, reached a stable condition after a\\nfew tracks. To date, although there are some numerical simula-\\ntions have been carried out to investigate the thermal behavior\\nduring laser processing of metal powder system, the rare re-\\nsearches focus on the thermal behavior and melting/solidi ﬁcation\\nmechanism during SLM of TiC/Inconel 718 powder system.\\nMeanwhile, the simulation three-dimensional models are needed\\nto be further perfected and optimized for more precise calculation\\nand simulating the actual fabrication process excellently.\\nIn this investigation, a three-dimensional ﬁnite element model\\nwas established based on the models mentioned above to predict\\nthe relationship between melting/solidi ﬁcation mechanism and\\nprocessing parameters, using ANSYS 13.0 software. Latent heat of\\nphase change, multiple heat transfer mechanisms, temperature-\\ndependent thermal physical properties and cooling time during\\npowder delivery were considered in order to precisely simulate\\nthe actual production process, as well as improve the calculation\\naccuracy. Moreover, the movement of Gaussian laser source and\\nthe laser energy loading of multi-layer and multi-track were rea-\\nlized using APDL secondary development language.

Model descriptions for SLM process\\n2.1. Physical description of SLM\\nFig. 1 depicts the schematic overview of the interaction zone\\nbetween laser radiation and powder. As the top surface of thepowder bed is irradiated by the incident laser beam, a smallfraction of laser energy is dissipated by radiation and convection.The remainder, the vast majority of laser energy, is absorbed bypowder particles, leading to the rapid heating and resultant loca-lized melting. After the moving Gaussian laser heat source leaves\\nthe melt region, which is called molten pool, rapid consolidation of\\nthe melt occurs. Then the metallurgical bonding is formed be-tween the adjacent tracks and the neighbor layers. The heattransfer mechanism of SLM process mainly includes laser radiationto powder bed, heat conduction among metal base plate andpowder particles and heat convection between the boundaries ofpowder layer and chamber atmosphere. These three coupled heattransfer mechanisms make the thermal behavior of SLM process\\nbecome extremely complex [20].\\n2.2. Basic setup of the ﬁnite element model\\nThe numerical simulation is carried out using ANSYS multi-\\nphysics ﬁnite element package to obtain a thorough understanding\\nof the temperature evolution behavior and resultant phenomenonlike temperature gradient, metallurgical defects and deformation\\nduring SLM process. The established three-dimensional ﬁnite\\nmodel and laser scan strategy during SLM process are shown inFig. 2 . The dimensions of the computational model of TiC/Inconel\\n718 powder bed are 1.4 mm /C20.385 mm /C20.1 mm with two layers.\\nThe height of each power layer is 50 mm and, the C45 medium\\ncarbon steel block with the dimensions of1.7 mm /C20.7 mm /C20.3 mm is taken as the metal substratebeneath the powder layers. The coordinate origin of this physical\\nmodel lies at the left bottom of the second powder layer as showninFig. 2 (a) and, its X-axis, Y-axis and Z-axis are located along the\\nlaser scan direction, perpendicular to the laser scan direction and\\nfrom top surface to bottom of the powder layers. Considering thecomputational precision and simulation ef ﬁciency, the ANSYS\\nSolid70 hexahedron element with the ﬁne mesh of\\n0.0175 mm /C20.0175 mm /C20.025 mm is utilized in the powder\\nbed, while, a relatively coarse tetrahedron mesh is adopted in the\\nsubstrate. The three-dimensional simulation model is meshed into\\n11,745 nodes and 25,532 elements in all. In order to mimic thecooling time involved during the delivery of each powder layer,\\nthere is a 10-ms cooling time between the fabrications of neighbor\\nlayers. This time is converted by the real time during powderdelivery of actual laser processing according to the ratio of the top\\nsurface area of the physical model and the area of the real powder\\ndelivery during previous experiments. Every calculating step isdivided into two smaller sub-steps for improving calculation pre-\\ncision. Each powder layer is processed track by track in a re-\\nciprocating raster pattern as shown in Fig. 2 (b). Point 1, Point\\n2 and Point 3 lie at the center of the ﬁrst scan track, second scan\\ntrack and fourth scan track, respectively. Path A-B locates on thetop surface of the ﬁrst powder layer along the Y direction at\\nX¼0.7 mm and Z ¼0.05 mm. The applied laser processing para-\\nmeters are listed in Table 1 .\\n2.3. Governing equations\\nIn selective laser melting, the localized heating of the powder\\nbed by the laser beam results in a heat transfer in the materialdominated by conductive heat transfer.

Theentire SLM process is conducted in the protection of argon atmo-\\nsphere. The processing parameters in the experiments are same as\\nthose in the simulation listed in the Table 1 . The samples for\\nmetallographic examinations were cut, ground and polished ac-\\ncording to standard procedures strictly. The cross-sectional mi-\\ncrostructures of the SLM-produced TiC/Inconel 718 parts were\\ncharacterized using a PMG3 optical microscopy (Olympus Cor-\\nporation, Japan). The characteristic surface morphologies of the\\nparts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM;\\nHitachi model S-4800, Japan) in secondary electron mode at 10 kV.\\n4. Results and discussion\\n4.1. Characteristics of temperature distributions in SLM process\\nFig. 3 shows the transient temperature distribution on the top\\nsurface and longitudinal view of the molten pool as laser beam\\nreaches Point 1, Point 2 and Point 3, respectively, with vof\\n100 mm/s and Pof 125 W ( Fig. 2 (b)). At the center of the ﬁrst track\\n(Point 1, Fig. 2 (b)), the isotherm curves on the top surface of the\\nmolten pool are similar to a series of ellipses and, the ellipses of\\nfore part are more intensive than those at the back-end of it.\\nMeantime, it is asymmetry of isotherms along the laser scanningdirection. However, this phenomenon is not conspicuous enough\\nas shown in temperature contour pots ( Fig. 3 ). The dashed line\\ncircle shown in the temperature contour plots presents the melt-\\ning temperature of Inconel 718 (1300 °C). The temperature in this\\ndashed line circle is higher compared with the melting point of\\nInconel 718, which induces a small molten pool within this region.\\nThe predicted operative temperature of the molten pool reduces\\nfrom 2113 °C in the center of the melt to 1182 °C at the edge of the\\nmolten pool as the laser beam reaches Point 1. Three dimensions\\nof the molten pool are approximately 95.5 mm (width), 106.5 mm\\n(length) and 61.3 mm (depth), respectively ( Fig. 3 (a) and (b)). Then\\nthe laser spot further moves to the Point 2, the working tem-\\nperature of the molten pool decreases from 2291 °C in the center\\nto 1290 °C at the edge of the molten pool. There, then, is a cooling\\ntime of 10-ms after the fabrication of n layer is completed by\\nscanning track by track and, then, the SLM process of n þ1l a y e r\\ncontinues. The predicted working temperature of the molten pool\\nranges from 2348\\n°C in the center to 1345 °C at the edge of the\\npool as the laser beam reaches Point 3. Comparing three dimen-\\nsions of molten pool in Point 2 with these three ﬁgures of the pool\\nin Point 1, the width (109.3 mm), length (120.7 mm) and depth\\n(67.8 mm) of the melt pool at Point 2 increases by 14.5%, 13.3% and\\n10.6%, respectively, to these at Point 1 ( Fig. 3 (c) and (d)). In addi-\\ntion, comparing these three ﬁgures of Point 3 with these of Point 1,\\nthe width (124.1 mm), length (132.2 mm) and depth (73.1 mm) of\\nthe molten pool at Point 3 are also slightly larger than these at\\nPoint 2, increasing by 13.5%, 9.5% and 7.8%, respectively ( Fig. 3\\n(e) and (f)).\\nThe simulation temperature contour plots show that the iso-\\ntherm ellipses of the fore-part of molten pool (unscanned region)\\narrange more intensive than these at back-end of the melt (scan-\\nned region). This is mainly attributed to the change of thermal\\nconductivities of TiC/Inconel 718, which are listed partly inTables 2 and 3, due to the transition from powder to solid. This\\nkind of transformation from powder to block contributes to theTable 2\\nThermal-physical parameters of Inconel 718 [26].\\nT[°C] 20 100 200 400 600 800 1300\\nks[W/(m °C)] 10 12 14 17 20 26 31\\nc[J/(kg °C)] 362 378 400 412 460 544 583\\nTable 3\\nThermal-physical parameters of TiC [27].\\nT[°C] 20 100 200 400 600 800 1300\\nks[W/(m °C)] 23 24 25 29 32 34 39\\nc[J/(kg °C)] 543 623 683 772 840 870 899Table 4\\nChemical compositions of Inconel 718 powder (in weight percent, wt%).\\nCr Mo Al Ti Fe Nb C Ni\\n18.4 4.2 0.3 0.9 17.7 5.1 0.08 BalanceQ.

During SLM process, the fabrication is completed track\\nby track and then layer by layer. The average temperature andmolten pool size described in simulation results are increasinggradually. This is mainly due to the fact that the heat stored inprevious produced part has a signi ﬁcant in ﬂuence on the next\\nprocessing tracks and layers, i.e. heat accumulation effect. Fur-thermore, the energy losses caused by conduction are higher thanthe radiation and convection during processing layer by layer, andthe development of shaped layers will weaken the ability of heat\\ndissipation by conduction [28]. This phenomenon leads to a higher\\ntemperature and a larger molten pool. Fortunately, the existence ofcooling time of 10-ms between productions of neighbor layers canrelieve heat accumulation to a certain extent, then controlling themolten pool size change in a quali ﬁed scope. Excellent dimen-\\nsional stability of molten pool size guarantees the homogeneity ofliquid column size and, resultantly, improving the quality of SLM-produces parts.\\n4.2. Molten pool dimensions at different SLM processing parameters\\nFig. 4 depicts the three dimensions of the molten pool under\\ndifferent laser powers and scan speeds during SLM process of TiC/Inconel 718. It is observed that the length, width and depth of the\\nmolten pool are approximately in positive liner relationship with\\nthe applied laser power. As the utilized power is increased from75 W to 150 W, the pronounced enhancement of three dimensionsof the molten pool, i.e. length (from 50.8 mmt o2 1 7 . 2 mm), width\\n(from 34.3 mmt o2 1 1 . 9 mm) and depth (from 27.3 mm to 85.3 mm),\\nrespectively, is observed ( Fig. 4 (a)). However, it can be seen that\\nthe three dimensions of the molten pool reduces with the incre-ment of the applied scan speed. On increasing the applied scan\\nspeed from 50 mm/s to 300 mm/s, the length of the molten pool\\ndecreases evidently from 239.8 mmt o9 1 . 2 mm. Meanwhile, the\\nwidth of the molten pool reduces from 215.2 mm to 78.0 mm and,\\nthe depth of the molten pool decreases from 91.6 mm to 49.8 mm\\n(Fig. 4 (b)). Further, the calculation results manifest that the de-\\ncreasing tendency becomes less pronounced as the utilized scanspeed is increased above 100 mm/s.\\nSince SLM is a multi-track and multi-layer additive manu-\\nfacturing based laser scanning, thus, a successful SLM fabricationshould be realized by the well bonding between adjacent scantracks and neighbor layers through rapid heating, completemelting and subsequent suf ﬁcient solidi ﬁcation [29]. The geo-\\nmetric dimension precision and density of the SLM-fabricated\\nparts are pronounced affected by the metallurgical bonding ability\\nbetween the neighbor layers and adjacent tracks. Furthermore,there is a signi ﬁcant connection between the metallurgicalbonding and three-dimension of the molten pool. As the combi-\\nnation of scan speed of 100 mm/s and laser power of 75 W isapplied, a narrow melt pool is obtained with its depth of 27.3 mm\\nand width of 34.3 mm, which is obviously less than the powder\\nlayer thickness (50 mm) and hatch spacing (50 mm), respectively,\\nthus, leading to the poor metallurgical bonding between neighborlayers and adjacent tracks since the necessary overlap is not rea-lized. At a relatively higher laser power of 100 W combined with aconstant scan speed of 100 mm/s, the obtained molten pool depth(53.6 mm) approximately equals to the thickness of powder layer,\\nresulting in a relatively weak metallurgical bonding between\\nneighbor layers. Moreover, when a high laser power (150 W) with\\nan extremely slow scan speed (50 mm/s) is utilized, the three di-mensions acquired (length: 239.8 mm, width: 215.2 mm and depth:\\n91.6 mm) are obviously larger than results required. Excessive re-\\nmelting of width and depth arising from large molten pool threedimensions results in the stress accumulation in the remeltingregion. It is responsible for the attendant microcracks in SLM-processed parts and distortion of the parts. It thus can be con-cluded that a SLM-fabricated part with high density and out-standing metallurgical bonding ability cannot be obtained underthe above mentioned laser processing conditions.\\n4.3. Effect of laser processing conditions on thermal behavior\\nFig. 5 shows the effects of laser processing parameters on the\\ntemperature distribution during SLM of TiC/Inconel 718 powdersystem along the Y-direction at X ¼\\n0.7 mm and Z ¼0.05 mm (path\\nA-B), and Z-direction at Point 2 ( Fig. 2 (b)). The slope of the curves\\nshown in the ﬁgures presents the temperature gradient of the\\npowder bed, and a steep slope means a relatively high tempera-ture gradient. When the laser power is increased from 75 W to150 W, the maximum temperature gradient along the path A-B\\npronouncedly increases from 1.30 /C210\\n4°C/mm to 2.60 /C2104°C/\\nmm ( Fig. 5 (a)). The maximum temperature gradient along the\\nZ-direction also signi ﬁcantly increases from 1.36 /C2104°C/mm to\\n2.62/C2104°C/mm. Furthermore, the temperature trend of each\\ncurve along Z-direction is obviously divided into four parts. Part(1) and part (2) present the fabricating powder layer. Part (3) andpart (4) mean the previous powder layer or metal substrate. Thetemperature distribution in every powder layer consists of twodifferent segments and the temperature gradient of upper powderlayer is higher than that of bottom powder layer.

When the laser scan speed is\\nincreased from 50 mm/s to 300 mm/s, the maximum temperature\\ngradient of different processing conditions ﬂuctuates around\\n2.18/C2103°C/mm along path A-B ( Fig. 5 (c)). Moreover, the tem-\\nperature distribution curves of different operative speeds along\\nZ-direction are approximately parallel arranged, where the max-\\nimum temperature gradient is about 2.40 /C2103°C/mm. Similarly,\\nthe temperature distribution curves along Z-direction of molten\\npool are divided into four parts under varying scan speeds as same\\nas these under different laser powers ( Fig. 5 (d)).\\nThe temperature distribution of the powder bed is affected\\ndirectly by the laser power and, the scan speed indirectly in ﬂu-\\nences temperature contour plots by changing the interaction time\\nbetween the powder particles and laser beam. Or more precisely,\\nthe laser power has a more pronounced in ﬂuence on the tem-\\nperature gradient around the molten pool than the scan speed, as\\ndepicted by Fig. 5 . Moreover, the maximum temperature gradient\\nin Z-direction of the melt pool is relatively larger than that ob-\\nserved in Y-direction of the pool, which attributes to the heat ﬂow\\ndirection in the molten pool. During SLM, the majority of laser\\nenergy is mainly dissipated through the pre-fabricated layers or\\nmetal substrate for the relatively higher thermal conductivity in\\nthis region. So the heat ﬂow direction during the SLM process is\\napproximately perpendicular to the surface of pre-processed lay-\\ners and the temperature gradient in this direction is highest [30].\\nThis high temperature gradient along Z-direction presents that\\nrapid heating and solidi ﬁcation during SLM is an unsteady-state\\nprocess. The microstructural features, like grain morphology, grainsize and its size distribution, in SLM-fabricated parts show some\\ninteresting variation along Z-direction correspondingly. Hofmeis-\\nter et al. [31] noted that the microstructure scale shows more\\nsensitive to variations in Z-direction height than to differences in\\nlaser power and traverse velocity. Furthermore, when a relatively\\nhigh laser power (150 W) is utilized, the ﬁnally solidi ﬁed parts\\nmay suffer from residual stress accumulation due to the large\\ntemperature gradient (2.62 /C2104°C/mm) between the hot melt\\nregion and the relatively cold substrate. This residual internal\\nstress is responsible for the local inaccuracy, warpage and even\\ndelamination [32,33].\\nFig. 6 depicts the variation of the maximum rate of temperature\\nchange with different processing conditions. It shows that the\\nmaximum rate of temperature change including the maximum\\nheating rate and the maximum cooling rate is generally in positive\\nlinear relation with the utilized laser power and scan speed. The\\nmaximum heating rate is higher slightly than the maximum\\ncooling rate ( Figs. 6 (a) and (b)). When the laser power is increased\\nfrom 75 W to 150 W, the maximum heating rate increases slightly\\nfrom 2.70 /C2106°C/s to 5.42 /C2106°C/s. The maximum cooling rate\\nfollows the similar variation tendency and it increases from\\n2.63/C2106°C/s to 5.25 /C2106°C/s. On increasing the applied scan\\nspeed from 50 mm/s to 300 mm/s, the maximum heating rate\\nincreases obviously from 2.30 /C2106°C/s to 1.30 /C2107°C/s. Mean-\\ntime, the maximum cooling rate increase from 2.21 /C2106°C/s to\\n1.26/C2107°C/s. Comparing the data from Fig. 6 (a) and (b), it re-\\nveals that the scan speed has a more signi ﬁcant effect than the\\nlaser power on the rate of temperature change. More precisely, the\\nrate of temperature change in the molten pool during SLM is more\\nsensitive to the scan speed than to the laser power.\\nFig. 5.

On the other hand, the processingconditions play a crucial role in in ﬂuencing thermal behavior and\\nattendant mechanical properties of as-fabricated parts. When the\\nlaser beam scans through the powder bed with a high speed\\n(300 mm/s) or a relatively high laser power (150 W), the particles\\nwithin the laser radiation region undergo an extremely rapidheating process with the maximum heating rate of 1.30 /C210\\n7°C/s,\\nwhich potentially results in thermo-capillary instability in the\\nmolten pool and droplets splashing from the melt pool. It is re-sponsible for the balling effect on the top surface of every fabri-\\ncating layer ( Fig. 1 ). Meanwhile, local residual stress accumulation\\nmaybe occurs for the enormous cooling rate of 1.26 /C210\\n7°C/s\\nunder scan speed of 300 mm/s or laser power of 150 W. It possibly\\ngives rise to the increment of cracking susceptibility, distortion of\\nSLM-processed parts and delamination between neighbor layers. It\\nis worth noting that the combination of the lower heating rate of\\n4.52/C2106°C/s and cooling rate of 4.38 /C2106°C/s has a tendency to\\nreduce the possibility of these above metallurgical defects under a\\nrelatively low scan speed of 100 mm/s and a laser power of 125 W.\\nIn addition, it is contributory to the re ﬁnement of microstructure\\nand, thus resultant synthesized mechanical properties of ﬁnal\\ncomponents for the rapid melting/rapid solidi ﬁcation mechanism.\\nThe variation of the maximum temperature and the liquid\\nlifetime of molten pool during SLM process with different para-\\nmeters are shown in Fig. 7 . It can be found clearly that the max-\\nimum temperature and the liquid lifetime are generally linear tothe applied laser power. When the laser power increased from\\n75 W to 150 W, the maximum temperature enhances sharply from1524 °C to 2690 °C as a result of the higher laser energy density\\ninput. Meanwhile, the liquid lifetime of molten pool increased si-\\nmilarly from 0.51 ms to 2.15 ms ( Fig. 7 (a)). On the other hand, as\\nthe utilized scan speed increased from 50 mm/s to 300 mm/s, the\\nmaximum temperature undergoes a slight decrement from\\n2495 °C to 2080 °C as an indirect response of the shorter interac-\\ntion time between powder particles and laser beam. Accordingly,\\nthe liquid lifetime also shortens from 5.15 ms to 0.30 ms. More-over, it should be noted that the enhancement tendency of max-\\nimum temperature and liquid lifetime are alleviated when the\\nscan speed is increased above 100 mm/s ( Fig. 7 (b)). In addition,\\ncomparing the data from Fig. 7 (a) and (b), it reveals that the laser\\npower has a more pronounced effect than the scan speed on the\\nmaximum temperature and, the liquid lifetime of the molten poolduring SLM is more sensitive to the scan speed than to the laser\\npower.\\nThe TiC/Inconel 718 powder system is melted by the laser en-\\nergy, which is directly in ﬂuenced by the laser power and indirectly\\naffected by the scan speed, to yield a high-temperature moltenpool during SLM process.

This phenomenon causes the appearance of\\nspherical pores and the attendant high porosity in SLM-produced\\nparts. Moreover, these pores appear generally in the back-end of\\nthe molten pool, as revealed by Fig. 1 . Meanwhile, when an over-\\nwhelmingly high scan speed (300 mm/s) or an exceedingly low\\nlaser power (75 W) is used, an extremely short liquid lifetime\\n(0.30 ms) and low temperature (1524 °C) occur, causing the for-\\nmation of a small amount of liquid phase with a relatively high\\nviscosity. It is detrimental for the wetting of the liquid phase\\namong the gaps of powders, generating the appearance of irre-\\ngular pores and the attendant high porosity in SLM-produced\\nparts.

Effects of different processing parameters on molten pool\\nconﬁguration\\nFig. 8 shows the melt depth and width divided by the total\\nenergy input (i.e. the melt depth per energy, Dper; the melt width\\nper energy, Wper) at different powers and scan speeds. The ratio of\\nthe depth per energy/the width per energy (i.e. RD/W) under the\\nsame processing parameters is depicted in Fig. 9 , as well as the\\nconﬁguration of the molten pool formed under corresponding\\nfabrication conditions in Fig. 10 . It can be seen that Dperand Wper\\nboth increase as the laser power is increased and, both reduce\\nwith the decrease of scan speed. As the laser power is enhanced\\nfrom 75 W to 150 W, the Wperincreases obviously from 2.61 mm/J\\nto 8.07 mm/J and, the Dperelevates slightly from 2.08 mm/J to\\n3.25 mm/J. Whereas the increasing tendency of the Dperis mod-\\nerate as the applied laser power is increased above 100 W ( Fig. 8\\n(a)), leading to a decrement of the RD/Wfrom 0.80 to 0.40 ( Fig. 9\\n(a)) and a wide-shallow cross section of the molten pool corre-\\nspondingly ( Fig. 10 (a)). On increasing the applied scan speed from\\n50 mm/s to 300 mm/s, the Wperincreases extremely from\\n4.92 mm/J to 10.70 mm/J, the Dperenhances considerately from\\n2.09 mm/J to 6.83 mm/J ( Fig. 8 (a)). As a result, the RD/Welevates\\nmonotonously from 0.42 to 0.63 ( Fig. 9 (b)) and, consequently, a\\nrelatively deep-narrow con ﬁguration of molten pool along the\\nY-direction is formed as a high scan speed is utilized ( Fig. 10 (b)).\\nA superior SLM-fabricated part is bonded by neighbor liquid\\ncolumns with homogeneous and appropriate radius, thus a further\\nunderstanding regarding the in ﬂuential factors of the dimensions\\nand con ﬁguration of liquid columns contributes to optimize theprocessing parameters and improve mechanical properties corre-\\nspondingly. Fig. 8 (a) and (b) re ﬂect the energy ef ﬁciency in Z-di-\\nrection and Y-direction of the molten pool, where the laser beam\\nand powder particles interact between each other, indicating the\\nheat ﬂow direction in the melt. They suggest that low power\\n(75 W) and high scan speed (300 mm/s) are more energy ef ﬁcient\\nin Z-direction of the molten pool. More precisely, the relatively\\nhigher laser energy ﬂows along Z-direction, leading to a higher\\nRD/W(0.80) and a resultantly deep-narrow cross sectional view of\\nthe molten pool ( Fig. 8 –10). Whereas a high laser power (150 W)\\nor a low scan speed (50 mm/s) causes a low RD/W (0.40) and a\\nwide-shallow cross section of the molten pool, meaning it is more\\nenergy ef ﬁcient in the Y-direction of the melt ( Fig. 8 –10). The\\nforming mechanism of the cross-sectional con ﬁguration of the\\nmolten pool at different processing conditions can be concluded as\\nfollows:\\n(1) The fusion enthalpy of TiC/Inconel 718 powder system is the\\nenergy barrier for melting powder particles. The melt gen-\\nerates when accumulated heat reaches the energy barrier.\\n(2) The laser beam with Gaussian power distribution reveals that\\nthe energy intensity of the laser beam periphery is pro-\\nnounced weaker than that in the center.\\n(3) The energy ( W¼Pt)accumulated in the periphery region\\ncannot satisfy the fusion enthalpy, i.e. energy barrier, to hinder\\nthe generation of the melt under a low laser power or a high\\nscan speed. However, the relatively more powerful laser en-\\nergy in the center of the beam is absorbed through radiation\\non the top surface and conduction in the powder bed to melt\\npowder along Z-direction, leading to a deep-narrow cross\\nsection of the molten pool. Differently, when a high laser\\npower or a low scan speed is applied, it is easily to melt\\npowder bed in both periphery and center region of the laserbeam since enough energy accumulated. That is responsible to\\ngenerate a wide and relatively shallow con ﬁguration of the\\nmolten pool.\\nConsequently, it is bene ﬁcial to reduce the hatch spacing when\\nthe molten pool con ﬁguration is deep and narrow and, improve\\nthat when a wide-shallow con ﬁguration generates for a com-\\nparatively smooth surface and excellent bonding properties.\\n4.5.

Layerwise micro-\\nstructure features were observed legibly, especially under the\\ncondition of laser power of 125 W, as a result of layer-by-layer\\nmelting and subsequent solidi ﬁcation of SLM process. At a lower\\nlaser power of 75 W, the irregular pores with large size which\\ncrossed over several layers, as well as the tiny molten pool width\\nof 35 mm and pool depth of 28 mm shown using white dot line in\\ntheﬁgure, were found ( Fig. 11 (a)). On enhancing the applied laser\\npower to 100 W, large-sized irregular pores disappeared while\\nsmall spherical pores occurred, which generally aggregated in the\\nback-end of the molten pool ( Figs. 11 (b) and 1). Meantime, the\\nwidth and depth of the molten pool increase to 76 mm and 45 mm,\\nrespectively. On further increasing the laser power to 125 W, the\\ndense morphology without any apparent pores, as well as the\\nappropriate width of 95 mm and depth of 60 mm, was formed, in-\\ndicating a pleasurable bonding between neighbor layers and ad-\\njacent tracks ( Fig. 11 (c)).\\nDuring the SLM process, the operative temperature and the\\namount of liquid phase with its viscosity are closely related with\\nthe laser energy. The powerful laser energy gives rise to a large\\namount of liquid formation with high temperature and low visc-\\nosity, which in turn promotes the liquid spreading out to ﬁll the\\nvoids among particles and, thus, improve the metallurgical\\nbonding properties between the neighbor layers. In view of the\\nabove experimental analyses, as well as the numerical simulation\\nresults, it can be found that the metallurgical bonding propertiesexperienced a signi ﬁcant improvement as the laser power is in-\\ncreased from 75 W to 125 W. At a lower laser power of 75 W, a\\nconsiderably small amount of liquid phase of TiC/Inconel 718 with\\nhigher viscosity is formed due to the lower temperature of\\n1524 °C, resulting in a shallower penetration of 28 mm(Figs. 7\\n(a) and 11(a)). It is responsible for the appearance of large-sized\\nirregular pores among layers and resultant poor metallurgical\\nbonding behavior between adjacent layers ( Fig. 11 (a)). On in-\\ncreasing the laser power to 100 W, the volume of liquid phase and\\npenetration increase, resulting from the enhancement of molten\\npool temperature of 1901 °C(Figs. 7 (a) and 11(b)). The irregular\\npores with large size are alleviated due to more liquid spreading\\nandﬁlling among particles. Whereas some spherical pores with\\nsmall size generate in the back-end of the molten pool since the\\ngas atoms release from the lattice in heat affected zone possibly, as\\ndemonstrated by Weingarten ( Figs. 1 and 11(b)) [34]. On further\\nincreasing the applied laser power to 125 W, a suf ﬁcient amount\\nliquid phase with lower viscosity, as well as the appropriate width\\nof 95 mm and depth of 60 mm, is formed for a higher temperature\\nof 2291 °C(Figs. 7 (a) and 11(c)). The smoothly spread liquid and\\nthe appropriate molten pool dimensions guarantee the sound\\nmetallurgical bonding ability between adjacent layers and re-\\nsultant high density of ﬁnal SLM-fabricated parts ( Fig. 11 (c)).

Conclusions\\nThe three-dimensional ﬁnite element model, considering the\\ncooling time for powder delivery, temperature-dependent prop-\\nerties, multiple heat transfer mechanisms and latent heat of phase\\nchange, was established to mainly focus on the effects of proces-\\nsing conditions on the thermal behavior and further melting/so-\\nlidiﬁcation mechanism, as well as forming mechanism of the\\nmolten pool con ﬁguration, and the following conclusions were\\ndrawn.\\n(1) The maximum temperature, the width, the length, and the\\ndepth of the molten pool increases by 8.4%, 14.5%, 13.3% and\\n10.6%, respectively, comparing the Point 2 with Point 1. While\\nthey are 2.5%, 13.5%, 9.5% and 7.8%, respectively, comparing the\\nPoint 3 with Point 2. This is mainly due to the heat accumu-\\nlation effect and the superior ability of conductions in powder\\nbed than convection/radiation. The set of cooling time of 10-\\nms is obviously bene ﬁcial for alleviating the heat accumula-\\ntion effect and, thus, controlling the liquid column size and\\nresultant quality of ﬁnal SLM parts.\\n(2) The maximum temperature gradient in the molten pool\\nslightly increases (from 1.30 /C2104°C/mm to 2.60 /C2104°C/mm\\nalong the path A-B; from 1.36 /C2104°C/mm to 2.62 /C2104°C/\\nmm in Z-direction) as the laser power is increased from 75 W\\nto 150 W. Whereas, it is affected negligibly by the variation of\\nscan speed.(3) The maximum rate of temperature change obviously increases\\n(heating: from 2.70 /C2106°C/s to 5.42 /C2106°C/s; cooling: from\\n2.63/C2106°C/s to 5.25 /C2106°C/s) when the laser power is\\nelevated from 75 W to 150 W. On increasing the applied scan\\nspeed from 50 mm/s to 300 mm/s, the maximum rate of\\ntemperature change similarly increases (heating: from\\n2.30/C2106°C/s to 1.30 /C2107°C/s; cooling: from 2.21 /C2106°C/s\\nto 1.26 /C2107°C/s).\\n(4) A low power (75 W) or a high scan speed (300 mm/s) is more\\nenergy ef ﬁcient in Z-direction of the molten pool, leading to a\\ndeep-narrow cross sectional view of the pool. Whereas, a high\\nlaser power (150 W) or a low scan speed (50 mm/s) causes a\\nlow RD/W (0.40) and a wide-shallow cross sectional con ﬁg-\\nuration of the molten pool, meaning it is more energy ef ﬁcient\\nin the Y-direction of the melt.\\n(5) The microstructures on cross-sectional view and surface\\nmorphology of ﬁnal parts were experimentally acquired,\\nwhich validated indirectly the results by simulation. These\\nindicated the sound metallurgical bonding between the\\nneighbor layers and adjacent tracks at the optimized combi-\\nnation of P¼125 W and v¼100 mm/s, due to the appropriate\\nthree dimensions of the molten pool (width: 109.3 mm;\\nlength: 120.7 mm; depth: 67.8 mm).\\n(6) The physical phenomena considered in this study are general\\nissues of temperature ﬁeld simulation and thermal behavior\\ninvestigation during SLM process.

In this study, amongst\\nthe many variables related to input energy, we investigate the eﬀ ectiveness of laser energy density (LED) on the\\nmelt pool geometry and microstructure of Hastelloy X single tracks produced by ﬁxed LED values at di ﬀerent\\nlaser powers and scanning velocities. The results reveal that for a ﬁxed LED, the higher laser power has a higher\\neﬀect on the melt pool depth. In addition, compared to the scanning velocity, laser power has a higher in ﬂuence\\non the melt pool geometry. Moreover, it is proposed that the ﬁner cell structure observed in the melt pool of high\\nlaser power is due to the higher cooling rates. Finally, the higher number of new grains observed in melt poolscreated with higher laser power and ﬁxed LED are likely due to the grain detachment caused by the increase in\\nthe partially melted particles.\\n1. Introduction\\nAdditive manufacturing (AM) of metallic parts has grown in popu-\\nlarity due to its ability to fabricate parts with complex designs [1]. Laser\\npowder-bed fusion (LPBF) is one of several AM techniques that builds\\nparts in a layer by layer fashion. This versatile powder bed process has\\nbeen used to manufacture parts with adjustable parameters such as\\nlaser power, scanning velocity, and layer thickness that can be opti-\\nmized to print defect-free parts. To achieve acceptable part quality with\\nno porosity, it is necessary to have consolidated layers made of single\\nlines. Thus, an in-depth understanding of the e ﬀect of process para-\\nmeters on a single track melt pool and the subsequent fast solidi ﬁcation\\nis required to produce condensed layers leading to high-quality parts\\nwith low porosity and high strength.Among all LPBF process parameters, energy input density has been\\nconsidered as one of the most signi ﬁcant variables [2,3] . The energy\\ninput can be written as a function of laser power, scanning velocity,layer thickness, hatching distance, and other variables [1,4,5] . How-\\never, based on the previous studies [6–8], laser power and scanning\\nvelocity are considered as the most e ﬀective parameters. Some aspects\\nof the single track formation (such as melt pool and bead geometry)under di ﬀerent sets of process parameters (laser power, scanning ve-\\nlocity, layer thickness, and hatching distance) have been studied for afew materials [2,3,9 –11]. The laser energy density (LED) is one of the\\nproposed energy input density functions and is deﬁ ned as the ratio of\\nlaser power to scanning velocity\\n()P\\nVJ\\nmm[12]. LED has been used to ﬁnd\\nthe process window for deposition of di ﬀerent materials in the LPBF\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.optlastec.2019.03.012\\nReceived 11 December 2018; Received in revised form 24 January 2019; Accepted 10 March 2019⁎Corresponding author.\\nE-mail address: ehsan.toyserkani@uwaterloo.ca (E.

In addition, LED has also been utilized to avoid balling,\\nirregular and discontinuous track shapes in LPBF [9,12] . It has also\\nbeen observed that incomplete melting can be the result of a low LED\\ndeposition, while a high LED deposition may introduce keyhole pores,\\nwhich are detrimental for additively manufactured parts [10].\\nInteraction of powder particles with laser irradiation during LPBF\\nresults in melting and solidi ﬁcation of molten metal. Similar to melting\\nprocess, understanding the solidi ﬁcation of melted particles and mi-\\ncrostructure formation in the melt pool is essential to reach the desired\\nmechanical properties. Since the process parameters directly a ﬀect the\\ngeometry of the melt pool, changes in microstructure are expected tooccur with di ﬀerent process parameters. Several studies have been\\nconducted to evaluate the in ﬂuence of process parameters on micro-\\nstructure of LPBF parts [2,13 –16]. Single track deposition of Inconel\\n718 showed that the beads produced with low LED result in columnargrains growing upwards, while high LED values lead to grains conver-\\nging at the center of the bead [13,15] . These long columnar grains\\nobserved in the microstructure of LPBF parts highlight the re-melting ofprevious layers resulting in the continuation of the crystallographic\\ngrain growth from grains in the former layers [2,14] . In addition, it was\\nreported that formation of slender columnar grains may be due to thehigh cooling rate during LPBF with di ﬀerent manufacturing conditions\\n[16].\\nIn this study, the e ﬀect of laser power, scanning velocity, and LED\\nvalues on the melt pool geometry and corresponding microstructure areinvestigated for Hastelloy X single tracks printed using a LPBF system.\\nAs discussed previously, LED values have been used as a guideline for\\nprinting e ﬀective LPBF parts. However, it has not been evaluated if the\\nLED criterion is valid for di ﬀerent materials produced with di ﬀerent\\nLED values. In addition, it is important to study the di ﬀerences, if any,\\nbetween the observed melt pool geometry and solidiﬁ ed microstructure\\natﬁxed LED values to evaluate the use of LED as a guideline for printing\\nLPBF parts. To conduct this research, a series of single track depositions\\nof Hastelloy X were performed to study the e ﬀect of changes in the laser\\npower and scanning velocity with ﬁxed LED values on the geometry and\\nmicrostructure of melt pool. Results reveal that for a ﬁxed LED, laser\\npower has a higher in ﬂuence on the melt pool dimensions (width and\\ndepth) while an increase in laser power has a higher e ﬀect on the melt\\npool depth. A ﬁner cell structure is observed in the melt pool of high\\nlaser power and is thought to be due to the higher cooling rates ob-\\nserved at higher laser power. Finally, it is proposed that the grain de-\\ntachment caused by the increase in number of partially melted particles\\n(PMP) is the mechanism for the higher number of new grains observed\\nin melt pools created with higher laser power.\\n2. Materials and methods\\nHastelloy X gas-atomized powder supplied by EOS GmbH, with the\\nchemical composition listed in Table 1 was used to fabricate the LPBF\\nparts with a D\\n10,D50,and D 90of 46.4 µm, 30 µm and 15.5 µm respec-\\ntively. As shown in Fig. 1, powder particles are mostly spherical in\\nshape with attached satellite particles.\\nThe experimental study was designed to manufacture12 rectangular\\nsubstrates of Hastelloy X with base dimensions\\nof××25 mm 17.5 mm 5 m m. Six single laser scans were applied on\\ntop of the 3D printed substrates to form single tracks of length 25 mm.Single tracks with varying laser scanning velocity and power were\\nprinted on di ﬀerent substrates while single tracks with the same laser\\nscanning velocity and power but di ﬀerent nominal layer thickness wereprinted on the same substrate. The 20, 40 and 60 µm single tracks were\\nprinted with a base nominal layer thickness of 20 µm where the laser\\nirradiation was skipped for 1 and 2 layers for the 40 and 60 µm, single\\ntracks. Every single track, with its respective dimensions, was printed\\ntwice adjacent to each other ( Fig. 2) and parallel to the direction of the\\nrecoater movement.\\nEOS M290, equipped with a Ytterbium ﬁber laser, was used for\\nfabricating the substrates and single tracks. As the laser spot size isconsidered to be a major contributing parameter to melt pool formation\\n[18,19] , it is important to mention the e ﬀective laser spot size of 80 µm\\nwas utilized in this experiment. All substrates were designed with thesame process parameters as default EOS Hastelloy X parameters.\\nPrinted substrates were double scanned on the last layer to get a smooth\\nsurface. After reviewing the process parameters used in available lit-\\neratures for Hastelloy X [20 –23], a speci ﬁc range of laser power and\\nscanning velocity were selected in this study. Three values of LED werechosen for single tracks at di ﬀerent laser powers and scanning velo-\\ncities, as listed in Table 2. Design of experiments for single line tracks\\nconsisted of varying laser powers (from 150 W to 300 W) and scanning\\nspeeds (from 600 mm/s to 2000 mm/s). The laser power and velocity\\nwere selected based on di ﬀerent LED values as shown in the 1st column\\nofTable 2. The completed specimens were cross-sectioned (4 repeti-\\ntions at 2.5 mm o ﬀsets from the ends of substrate) using a Struers Ac-\\ncutom-50 precision cutter for a total of 4 cross-sections per single trackcondition.\\nThe samples were manually polished using progressively ﬁner SiC\\ngrinding papers from 320 to 4000 grit sizes. Finally, the samples were\\npolished with 1, 0.1 and 0.05 µm alumina slurry and rinsed with\\nethanol to remove residual alumina from the surface of the samples.\\nPolished samples were kept in Glyceregia [24]\\n(\\n−− − HCl50ml HNO310ml Glycerol10ml ) solution for about one\\nminute for etching.

Results and discussion\\nAs mentioned previously, single tracks of Hastelloy X on the LPBF-\\nmade substrate were produced with the laser power range from 150 to\\n300 W with scanning velocities from 600 to 2000 mm/s and layer\\nthickness from 20 to 60 µm. Fig. 3(a) and 3(b) show the depth and\\nwidth of the melt pool region as a function of laser power in which thered, green, and blue colors represent LED values of 0.25 J/mm, 0.20 J/\\nmm, and 0.15 J/mm, respectively. Similarly, triangular, circular, and\\nrectangular markers represent a layer thickness of 20 µm, 40 µm and\\n60 µm, respectively. Fig. 3(a) and 3(b) demonstrate that the width of\\nthe melt pool is increasing from\\n±μ93 9mto±μ121 8mand depth of\\nthe melt pool is increasing from ±μ41.8 6mto±μ94 9mwhile the\\nLED increased from 0.15 J/mm to 0.25 J/mm at a ﬁxed laser power of\\n300 W. A similar trend was also observed by Sadowski et al for LPBF of\\nInconel 718 [2]. However, here, a general upward trend for both width\\nand depth of the melt pool is observed while increasing the laser powerat a constant LED. For instance, at a constant LED of 0.25 J/mm, the\\nmelt pool depth and width change around 25% and 4%, respectively\\nwith changing laser power from 150 W to 300 W and scanning speeds\\nfrom 600 mm/s to 1200 mm/s.\\nThe higher LED results in a higher energy input into the system,\\ntherefore it is expected to produce a bigger melt pool dimensions which\\ncan be con ﬁrmed by the data presented in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b). It is also\\nreported by Aversa et al [3]that a higher LED value for a single line\\ndramatically increases the depth of the melt pool of AlSi10Mg alloy. A\\nlower LED with a shallower melt pool results in a smaller contact area\\nbetween the molten metal and the substrate. As a result, there is less\\nwetting of the molten metal on the surface and the tracks become more\\nirregular or undergo balling before solidi ﬁcation [25]. To avoid this,\\nprocess parameters need to be carefully selected to create an appro-priate melt pool depth.\\nResults in Fig. 3 can also be used to analyze the e ﬀect of layer\\nthickness on the melt pool geometry of printed single tracks. However,\\nit is in contrast to what has been observed in the literature where in-\\ncreasing layer thickness results to have shallower melt pools and moreballing observed for single track [25]. Results from the current study\\nshow no speci ﬁc deviation for the geometry of the melt pool when the\\nnominal layer thickness changed from 20 µm to 60 µm.\\nAs was observed in Fig. 3, melt pool dimensions do not show any\\nsigniﬁcant change with the change in layer thickness. Insigni ﬁcant\\nchanges in the melt pool dimensions of single tracks with respect to\\ndiﬀerent layer thicknesses may be due to the fact that the e ﬀective\\npowder layer thickness is much bigger than the nominal or build layerthickness as reported by Mahmoodkhani et al. [26]. The actual layer\\nthickness in LPBF is not constant and increases from the beginning ofthe process to reach a steady state known as the e ﬀective layer thick-\\nness (ELT) [27,28] . In this study, since only the last deposited layer ’s\\nnominal thickness was changed from 20 to 60 µm, the e ﬀective layer\\nthickness from former layers appears to be dominant in terms of con-trolling the melt pool geometry.\\nInsigni ﬁcant changes in the melt pool size by changing the layer\\nthickness could also be explained due to the surface roughness of the\\nprevious layer. It is well known that the rough surface of the last de-\\nposited layer makes height to be di ﬀerent at di ﬀerent locations on the\\ntop surface during LPBF manufacturing process [29]. This leads to a\\nnon-uniform powder layer added by the recoater for subsequent layers\\nwhich may be greater than the nominal layer thickness thus negating\\nthe eﬀect of changing layer thickness on melt pool dimensions. Fig. 4\\ndemonstrates the height map of the top surface of the printed Hastelloy\\nX substrate with printed single tracks. Measurement along the single-\\ntrack\\ndeposition (white line in Fig. 4) shows up to 80 µm variation in\\nheight of the substrate, which is much larger than the maximumnominal layer thickness (60 µm) used in this study. This variation in\\nheight a ﬀect the local layer thickness of powder during the next de-\\nposition step and therefore does not show any e ﬀect of layer thickness\\non melt pool dimensions of printed single tracks.\\nExperimental results from melt pool dimensions with varying laser\\npower and LED show the e ﬀect of melt pool width and depth with ﬁxed\\nLED. However, it is important to investigate the e ﬀect of laser power\\nand velocity individually. Fig. 5 illustrates the e ﬀect of changing the\\nLED from 0.15 J/mm to 0.25 J/mm on the melt pool dimensions at a\\nFig. 2.

Results in Fig. 5 (a) and (b) show that whilst\\nkeeping the scan velocity constant, decreasing the LED from 0.25 J/mm\\nto 0.15 J/mm results in about a 65% and 30% decrease in melt pool\\ndepth and width, respectively. While with ﬁxed power and decreasing\\nLED from 0.25 J/mm to 0.15 J/mm results in about 38% and 13% re-duction in melt pool depth and width correspondingly. Therefore, in-\\ncreasing the scanning velocity has a weaker in ﬂuence on the melting\\nregime compared to a proportional increase in laser power.\\nAs discussed previously, the impact of change in laser power is\\nstronger than corresponding changes in scanning velocity on the meltpool geometry. It is also observed that the melt pool width is larger than\\nthe laser beam spot size (80 µm) due to the heat dissipation from molten\\nmetal to solid material. Considering the Gaussian distribution of the\\nlaser heat source, the average laser radiation intensity at the center of\\nthe beam pro ﬁle is considerably higher than the intensity at the edges\\n[28,30] . In addition, due to the Gaussian distribution, the input energy\\nat the edges is less sensitive to the laser power or scanning velocity\\nchanges than at the center. The higher intensity at the center of the\\nlaser beam leads to an increase in the surface temperature of themelting metal to the boiling temperature of the metal, which causes\\nrecoil pressure on the melt pool and leads to the surface depression in\\nthis area [31 –33]. This depression, along with higher temperatures at\\nthe central zone of the melt pool, provides a driving force for the meltpool penetration while increasing the melt pool depth. This explains the\\ngreater sensitivity of the melt pool depth when compared to the width\\nwhen input energy is changed either by the varying scanning velocity orlaser power.\\nIt is well known that microstructure can be a ﬀected by variation in\\nprocess parameter [11,13,34] .Fig. 6(a) and (b) show SEM images with\\nLEDs of 0.25 J/mm and 0.15 J/mm at laser powers of 300 W and 150 Wrespectively.

Comparing the microstructures reveals\\nthat at a ﬁxed LED, the cell size increased from 0.285 ± 0.05 µm to\\n0.5 ± 0.1 µm when the laser power increases from 150 W to 300 W. Ascell size is directly related to mechanical properties such as hardness\\n[39,40] , it is important to individually investigate the variation of cell\\nspacing with respect to the ﬁxed LED criteria. Reduction in cell spacing\\nresults in higher hardness [39,40] due to higher number of cell\\nboundaries enriched by dislocations [36,37] .\\nCell spacing in the microstructure strongly depends on the cooling\\nrate at the solid-liquid interface during solidi ﬁcation [34]. High tem-\\nperature gradients (G) and high solidi ﬁcation rate (R) in the melt pool\\nresult in higher cooling rate.

Therefore, it canbe concluded that the change in cooling rate at di ﬀerent process\\nparameters a ﬀects the temperature gradient and solidiﬁ cation rate on\\nthe printed single tracks.

This is important as grain morphology has been linked to\\nmaterial performance such as yield strength [40,44,45] .Fig. 8a –b\\nshows inverse pole- ﬁgure maps of two cross-sectioned single tracks at a\\nLED value of 0.25 J/mm with laser power of 150 W and 300 W. Melt\\npool boundaries have been detected from optical images of etched\\nsamples and superimposed on the EBSD maps. EBSD results in Fig. 8\\nshow the melt pool and the bead area from the cross-sectioned singletracks. Melt pool IPF maps show the grain growth due to epitaxial\\ngrowth of grains at the melt pool boundary for both cross-sections in the\\nbuilding direction. Similar results of epitaxial growth have also been\\nobserved by other research groups from microstructure of LPBF parts\\n[5,13,36] . In addition, a few number of nucleated grains are also ob-\\nserved in the middle of the melt pool with misorientation of more than15˚with neighboring grains. A total of 5 new grains (highlighted in\\nFig. 8(a)) were identi ﬁed with the lower laser power (150 W), whereas\\n11 new grains (highlighted in Fig. 8(b)) were observed with the higher\\nlaser power (300 W) at the same LED value. The average number for\\nnew grains, which are observed from di ﬀerent cross-sections, was cal-\\nculated to be about 6 ± 2 and 11 ± 1 for laser power of 150 W and300 W, respectively. This di ﬀerence in the number of grains, would\\nresult in a ﬁner grain structure that would a ﬀect the mechanical\\nproperties of the printed parts.\\nAs grain nucleation is observed in the melt pools from EBSD results,\\nit is important to identify the nucleation mechanisms for the presence of\\nnew grains. Four di ﬀerent nucleation mechanisms namely; dendrite\\nfragmentation, surface, homogenous/heterogeneous nucleation, andgrain detachment have been identi ﬁed during rapid solidi ﬁcation of\\nmetallic alloys [34]. Due to the existence of cellular structure observed\\nin the single tracks ( Fig. 6), the possibility of dendrite defragmentation\\nmechanism is very low. Also, since epitaxial grain growth is observed inthe melt pool of single tracks, surface nucleation is not a viable option.\\nIf the solute partition coe ﬃcient of alloying elements is less than 1, it is\\npossible to have solute pile-up in front of the solid-liquid boundaryduring solidi ﬁcation, which results in the segregation of alloying ele-\\nments [46]. Segregation in front of the solid-liquid interface can lead to\\nthe high constitutional undercooling, which should be followed by\\nhomogenous nucleation of equiaxed grains in the middle of the melt\\npool [47]. However, according to the EDS line scanning analysis for the\\nsingle track deposition, it is shown in Fig. 9 that there is no signi ﬁcant\\nsegregation of main alloying elements along the melt pool depth. EDS\\nline scanning of melt pools was repeated for two di ﬀerent cross-sections\\nof\\nsingle tracks with LED of 0.15 J/mm and LED of 0.25 J/mm. Results\\nfrom both extreme LED values shows lack of segregation in printed\\nHastelloy X samples. This lack of segregation may be attributed due to\\nthe rapid solidi ﬁcation of the melt pool region during the LPBF process\\n[35]. EDS results ( Fig. 9) show a lack of segregation in the concentra-\\ntion of alloying elements which would not change the undercoolingtemperature of the melted metal at the center of the melt pool. As\\nhomogeneous nucleation rate is linked to segregation of alloying ele-\\nments [48], it can be concluded that the observed changes in nucleation\\nrate in Hastelloy X is not due to this mechanism.\\nBased on the discussion presented thus far, grain detachment might\\nbe the best explanation for nucleation of the grains in the melt poolduring solidi ﬁcation. Due to the Bernoulli e ﬀect, metal evaporation\\nduring the LPBF process enables the ﬂow of inert gas (argon) toward\\nthe middle of the melt pool [28]. With the help of high-speed imaging,\\nit is shown that this inert gas ﬂow from the surrounding is strong en-\\nough to start the ﬂow of powder particles towards the melt pool [28].\\nSome of these particles become part of the melt pool while others attachto the periphery. The partially melted particles attach to the solidi ﬁed\\nmetal and may act as nucleation sites for grain growth. On the otherhand, molten metal from these PMPs could enter the melt pool to create\\na potential nuclei inside the melt pool causing grain detachment. SEM\\nsecondary mode image and EBSD IPF maps from a cross-sectioned\\nsingle track is presented in Fig. 10 . In addition to that, Fig. 10 shows\\nthree attached particles surrounding the bead region (shown by redareas of A, B, and C). These attached particles might have originated\\nfrom adjacent powders or spatter particles produced during LPBF. As\\nnew grains formed around the periphery of the attached particles do not\\nshow epitaxial growth, it can be concluded that grain detachment is the\\ndominant mechanism. Results from attached particle show a signi ﬁcant\\namount of new orientated grains in the solidi ﬁed bead region. All the\\nattached particles (A-C) show detached grain growth along with heat\\nﬂow direction after reaching a substantial under cooling temperature.\\nThe bigger size of the attached particle B leads to have more newlyorientated grains in the microstructure on the left side of the melt pool\\nwhen compared to the particle C in Fig. 10.\\nIPF maps shown above highlight the formation mechanism for new\\ngrains in the solidi ﬁed single track.

It is observed, that the melt\\npool width always exceeds the laser beam diameter and the melt pool\\nwidth is proportional to the laser power ( Fig. 5(b)). Therefore, a higher\\nlaser power creates a melt pool larger than the laser diameter. This areacan be distributed into the hot and cold regions where the hot region\\ncorresponds to the area under direct laser irradiation while the cold\\nregion corresponds to the di ﬀerence between the direct laser irradiation\\nand the melt pool width ( Fig. 11 (a)). Any powder in the hot section\\nwould melt completely. However, powder in the cooler band may\\npartially melt and remain in the melt pool as a PMP. However, this\\ncooler band is directly proportional to the laser power. For example, a\\ncooler band increase from ∼37 µm to ∼45 µm is observed when the\\nlaser power is increased from 150 W to 300 W at ﬁx LED. As the cooler\\nband increases with laser power, the amount of PMPs in the melt pool\\nwould also increase. As these particles have been shown to cause nu-\\ncleation in the melt pool, a higher number of PMPs would result in\\nmore grains inside the melt pool as shown in Fig. 8. Moreover, while the\\nlaser irradiation is directly above the area of interest, Marangoni con-vection of surface molten metal ﬂows from the center to the periphery\\nof the melt pool [49]. This pushes PMPs to cooler bands until the laserbeam passes. This results in an average of 5 more nucleated grainswithin the melt pool with higher laser power at constant LED ( Fig. 8).\\nThe increase in PMP observed at higher power can also be attributed\\nto the denudation zone created during laser irradiation [31]. It has been\\nreported that higher laser power results in a wider denuded powderzone around the single track [50]. In addition, laser power has a higher\\neﬀect than the scanning velocity on the denudation zone [50]. Based on\\nthis, higher laser power would result in addition of more powder par-\\nticles in the melt pool which would increase the probability of existence\\nof PMPs.\\n4. Conclusion\\nIn this work, independent of the laser power, scanning velocity and\\nlayer thickness, changing the LED (de ﬁned as the ratio of beam power\\nto scanning velocity\\n()P\\nVJ\\nmmvalue) resulted in signi ﬁcant e ﬀects on the\\ngeometry of melt pool in Hastelloy X. However, keeping the LED con-\\nstant at di ﬀerent laser powers and process speeds did not necessarily\\nresult in the same melt pool geometry or microstructure. The followingpoints express the most important conclusions of this study:\\n1. The laser power has a higher e ﬀect on the melt pool dimensions than\\nthe scanning velocity. Decreasing the laser power with ﬁxed scan-\\nning velocity (LED from 0.25 J/mm to 0.15 J/mm) results in about a\\n65% and 30% decrease in melt pool depth and width respectively.\\nSimilarly, increasing the scanning speed at a ﬁxed power (LED from\\n0.25 J/mm to 0.15 J/mm) results in about 38% and 13% reductionin melt pool depth and width respectively.\\n2. Atﬁxed LEDs, variation in melt pool dimensions is unavoidable due\\nto the stronger in ﬂuence of the laser power on the melting regime.\\nFor example, at LED of 0.25 J/mm, increasing the laser power from\\n150 W to 300 W results in increasing the melt pool depth by ∼56%.\\n3. It is proposed that the di ﬀerence in average primary cell spacing\\n(from 285 nm to 500 nm at LED of 0.25 J/mm) with an increase in\\nlaser power from 150 W to 300 W is linked with the cooling rate and\\ncan be explained by the change in the ratio of\\nmeltpoolvolume\\nsurfaceboundary.\\n4. In general, the microstructure of the cross-section single track melt\\npools shows a cellular structure with epitaxial growth of grains at\\nmelt pool boundaries.

Thus far, several metallic materials including different types of ferrous alloys have been additively\\nmanufactured to full density with better or equivalent properties compared to counterparts made by conven-tional methods. In this perspective, this review article presents different powder-based additive manufacturingprocesses deployed to ferrous alloys, their key process parameters, phase transformation and microstructure de-\\nvelopment during solidi ﬁcation, all of which impact on mechanical behavior. The article enlightens the basics of\\nLaser Powder-Bed (LPB, also known as selective laser melting), Laser Powder-Fed (LPF) and Binder Jetting (BJ)\\nAM processes. These processes involve a sequence of complex/rapid thermal cycle and solidi ﬁcation behavior\\nthat in ﬂuence the development of microstructure and eventually control the mechanical properties. A thorough\\ndiscussion on mechanical behaviors, i.e., hardness, tensile, and cyclic/fatigue properties of AM manufacturedsteels is also presented based on several combined process parameters.\\n© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\\nAM is a rapidly growing technique, where digital 3D design data is\\nused to directly build up a product in a layer-by-layer process followingdeposition, melting, fusion and binding of the successive material layers\\n[1]. It is a direct manufacturing technology that enables to fabricate\\ncomponents composed of metal, polymer, ceramic, and compositeswith intricate features through external and internal layout, and reduce\\nmaterial consumption [ 2,3]. Metal AM technology has attracted indus-\\ntry/researchers where it offers unique applications in various industriesfor replacement or customization of parts with complex geometries,Materials and Design 144 (2018) 98 –128\\n⁎Corresponding author.\\nE-mail address: ehsan.toyserkani@uwaterloo.ca (E.

Additional\\nadvantages of AM are: enabling consolidated parts for complex assem-\\nbly, rapid production of prototypes and reduced design iterations, and\\nfaster market introduction of new products [ 7].\\nIn contrast to the conventional cast and thermo-mechanical tech-\\nnique of material processing, in AM, there are limited options to modify\\nthe microstructures after manufacture, mostly because products are\\nfabricated to near-net shape. Also, in the AM fabrication process, parts\\nnormally show signi ﬁcant anisotropy in properties along and perpen-\\ndicular to the deposited layers. Samples deposited parallel (e.g. horizon-tal) or perpendicular (e.g. vertical) to the substrate undergo a different\\nthermal history resulting in anisotropic mechanical properties [ 8,9]. The\\nexact impact of process design parameters on physical and mechanicalbehaviors, and thus conformity of engineering parts fabricated via AM\\nis still not well understood. Therefore, determination of the mechanical\\nbehaviors and also the in ﬂuence of process design parameters for AM\\nparts are of vital importance to predict their performance in service [ 10].\\nThe goal of this paper is not to include all the existing studies related\\nto AM of ferrous alloys but to provide an overview for researchers to un-derstand signi ﬁcant and imminent research problems or opportunities\\nas well as the R&D trend in this area. To this end, the most common me-chanical properties reported in the literature for various ferrous alloys\\nas well as process parameters control to achieve high density, near-\\nnet shape AM parts are investigated and reported for three AM tech-\\nniques; Laser Powder-Bed (LPB), Laser Powder-Fed (LPF) and Binder\\nJetting (BJ) that are mainly used for the fabrication of parts composed\\nof ferrous alloys. Electron-beam powder-bed fusion (EPBF) has also\\nbeen used for the fabrication of parts composed of ferrous alloys; how-ever, due to a very limited number of papers in the literature, the detail\\nof this process is not included in the critical analysis. In addition, AM ofMetal Matrix Composites (MMCs) with ferrous alloys reinforcement el-ements, their process types and parameters, microstructural and me-\\nchanical properties are brie ﬂy summarized.\\n2. Additive manufacturing processes\\n2.1. Laser powder-bed (LPB)\\nLPB falls under powder-bed fusion AM according to ASTM commit-\\ntee F42 standard. LPB, also known as laser powder-bed fusion or selec-\\ntive laser melting (SLM), is a layer-upon-layer AM technique, where\\npowder is spread in a layer and melted using a focused laser beam as\\nshown in Fig. 1 , to produce dense metallic parts. In this process, the ob-\\ntainable geometric tolerance and minimum feature sizes are between40 and 200 μm[11]. The overhanging geometry is supported by\\nunmelted powder from previous layers. The main limitations for LPBare low build rate and the need to clear unmelted powder from internal\\ngeometry. A review with typical process applications can be found in\\n[12]. LPB is widely used in multidisciplinary arenas such as, (1) in engi-\\nneering to manufacture light weight machine parts, complex geometri-cal components, fuel cell, architectural design etc., (2) it also has\\ndemand in medical and dental applications because of some unique\\nproperties. The review identi ﬁed two LPB topics generally applicable\\nto any alloy, namely: (i) process optimization to maximize build rateat full density, (ii) microstructure control versus mechanical properties.\\nThe operating design of LPB is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 a. In\\nthis technique, a numerically developed hatch stripe pattern is used\\nover which the laser beam is scanned to melt the deposited powder\\nlayer as shown in Fig. 1 b[13]. The main process parameters used in\\nLPB are schematically shown in Fig. 1 b, where the area is divided into\\nstripes; comprising of several tracks detached by hatch spacing. The\\ntrack is fabricated using laser beam with a ﬁxed scan speed. During\\nlaser scanning process, an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen is intro-duced into the chamber to minimize oxidation. The platform is heated\\nto about 80 °C before depositing and melting of the powder. After com-\\npleting the process, the left-over powder is vacuumed and screened tob\\ne reused.\\n2.2. Laser powder-fed (LPF)\\nLPF falls under Directed Energy Deposition (DED) based on ASTM\\ncommittee F42 standard. It is a class of laser-based additive manufactur-ing processes to synthesize full-density and high-performance complex\\nmetallic functional components. It is also known as laser consolidation,\\nlaser direct metal fabrication, laser cladding with blown powder, etc.\\nThis technique is based on a laser beam, focused on a speci ﬁca r e ao fa\\npart where the powder is simultaneously supplied through a nozzlepointing to the same area, layer by layer. In contrast to the LPB process,\\nwhich employs a bed of powder metal that is ‘selectively ’melted by a\\nlaser, LPF is accomplished by simultaneously delivering metallic powderand focused laser energy, as schematically shown in Fig. 2 .\\nIn LPF, a high power laser (e.g., Fiber, Disk, Nd:YAG or CO\\n2) is used to\\nfabricate a melt zone on a substrate within an inert atmosphere; simul-\\ntaneously, powder is injected to the melt through the laser beam. Sub-\\nsequently, parts are made layer by layer using a 3D CAD ﬁle with each\\nlayer assembled track-upon-track via a controlled tool-path.\\nAdvantages of the LPF process include the production of near-net-\\nshape, full density parts with good mechanical properties and minimalimperfections (e.g. micro-cracking, distortion) [ 10,15]. A broad range\\nof LPF applications was observed to various areas, including: 1) netshaped solid metallic parts, 2) functionally graded materials, 3) cellular\\nsolids, 4) in-situ alloyed parts, and 5) parts with conformal/internal fea-\\ntures. However, predicting the properties of fabricated parts is very\\ncomplicated due to the many process variables involved.

Binder jetting (BJ)\\nIn the binder jetting AM process (one of the AM classes based on\\nASTM standard), complex metal parts are fabricated using different ma-\\nterials by selectively injecting liquid binder agent into a powder bed.\\nThe BJ process is schematically shown in Fig. 3 . After one layer is printed,\\na counter-rotating roller or a wiping blade spreads a new layer of pow-der on the surface of the prior layer, which is subsequently printed and\\nstitched with the earlier one through jetted binder. This procedure is re-\\npeated to ﬁnish the green part formation. The BJ printing process is\\ncompleted by post-sintering of 3D printed green parts in a high-temperature furnace, where the polymeric binder is burned off and\\nthe powder particles are sintered together through atomic diffusion to\\nachieve ﬁnal density and strength [ 16,17].\\nThe main advantages of the BJ technique are: (1) the prevention of\\nresidual stresses in the printed parts due to the absence of rapid heatingand cooling of the melt pool, (2) no need to support structure and build\\nsubstrate, (3) no need for environmentally controlled chamber during\\nthe green parts fabrication, (4) compatible with highly re ﬂective mate-\\nrials in contrast to LPB [ 16]. However, one of the major drawbacks of the\\nBJ process is the dif ﬁculty to reach full density parts after the post-\\nsintering, leading to reduced mechanical performance of the BJ-madeparts compared to conventional manufactured ones [ 18]. Moreover, BJ\\nis usually unable to process ultra- ﬁne and loosely packed powders.\\nUltra- ﬁne powders are dif ﬁcult to spread owing to low ﬂowability and\\npotential powder agglomeration due to humidity, creating defects inthe green parts. The sintered products will experience a signi ﬁcant di-\\nmensional change and reduction in mechanical properties [ 19].\\nWithin the steel family, the use of metal BJ process has been limited\\nto the fabrication of end-use products from stainless steel (SS) powders.Binder jetted SS materials have shown applications in the area of aero-\\nspace, energy, automotive, prosthetics [ 21,22], microwave circuits and\\nantennas [ 23], art, and design industry as rotors, stators, impellers, etc.\\noffering a signi ﬁcant manufacturing time reduction and impactful\\nweight and cost savings [ 24]. For example, meshed Ku band waveguides\\nof 420 SS are fabricated using the BJ process, which reduces the material\\nusage and weight by 22% while obtaining the low loss characteristic of\\nmetallic waveguides [ 23].\\n2.4. Electron-beam powder-bed fusion (EPBF)\\nEPBF falls under the class of powder-bed fusion AM as per the ASTM\\nstandard F3001-14 [ 25], which is a layer-by-layer process with similarcapabilities to LPB [ 26], as schematically shown in Fig. 4 . Electrostatic\\ncharge is a consideration, leading to use of slightly larger powder(b40μm fraction excluded [ 27]). The main process differences are the\\nneed for high vacuum and the use of the electron beam to pre-heatthe powder bed. Use of vacuum is bene ﬁcia\\nl in eliminating impurities\\nsuch as oxygen; however, it can also strip out low boiling point alloyingagents such as Mn [ 28]. Electron beam heating provides interesting de-\\nsign capabilities for microstructure control [ 29], but its capabilities ap-\\npear to be largely unstudied in ferrous alloys. Work with ferrous alloysis limited to two reports, which note that the cooling rate in the build\\nchamber was insuf ﬁcient to harden H13 tool steel [ 28]. This is disadvan-\\ntageous for less hardenable low alloy materials but may lead to moreconsistent microstructure for higher alloy materials where post pro-\\ncessing heat treatment is necessary. Arcam AB (A GE Additive company)\\nis the only commercial equipment supplier for EPBF equipment and\\nholds the process under patent until 2022 [ 25]. This causes limited\\nnew material development from this process [ 25,30]. However, it is rea-\\nsonable to expect the ﬁeld to open up as Arcam's patents expire.\\n3. Reﬂection on the number of relevant papers covering ferrous\\nalloys\\nFig. 5 a, b illustrate the volume of papers associated with different\\nkinds of steels processed by various AM processes. Among them, major-ity of the work is reported using the LPB process (155 papers) followed\\nby the LPF process (54 papers), to the best knowledge of the authors and\\nas of August 2017.\\nIn the literature, the BJ process (15 papers) is limited to 420 SS and\\n316 SS. However, compared to others, the EPBF process (2 papers) is\\nonly available for limited work on H13 tool steel. Therefore, based on\\nthe literature, suf ﬁcient study is not available to do a critical review of\\nthe EPBF process.\\nFor various AM processes of LPB, LPF and BJ, the pie charts in Fig. 6 a–\\nc represent the detail studies for each technique that have used steelpowders of various compositions. In the LPB process, as shown in\\nFig. 6 a, almost equal amount of work has been done on H13 tool steel,\\nmaraging steel and M2 HSS.\\nFor other SS, i.e. 316 SS, 420 SS, 17-4 PH SS and low alloy steels, very\\nlimited work has been reported using LPB. From Fig. 6 b, it was observed\\nthat in LPF, the most researched steel powders were 316 L SS and H13tool steel followed by low alloy steels. However, only a limited amount\\nof LPF studies have been reported on using 420 SS, 304 SS and maraging\\nsteel. In contrast to LPB, in BJ as shown in Fig. 6 c, most of the work has\\nbeen done with 316 SS and 420 SS. Also, the process covers a smallquantity of work on pure iron, 430 SS and 410 SS.\\nFig. 1.

Energy ratio\\nA consensus in the literature is that some measure of energy density\\nis one of the best predictors for parts relative density for both LPB and\\nLPF. A variety of energy density measures are used in the literature\\nwith a volumetric density approach. Volumetric density may have the\\nadvantages that it can be normalized against material enthalpy to be\\nused for the comparison of multiple materials. However, some argu-\\nments have been made that the melting of multiple layers and also key-\\nhole shape of the melt pool invalidates the use of layer thickness for the\\nvertical length scale parameter [ 43]. This is backed by the observation in\\nthe next section that the layer thickness is highly correlated with opti-mum heat pulse depth. It is expected that the melted volume does not\\ndirectly correspond to the cube de ﬁned by Volumetric Energy Density\\n(VED), but that melted volume will scale fairly linearly with the volumeof this cube for successful recipes [ 44,45].

Surface tension\\nIn both LPB and LPF, surface tension plays an important role as it dic-\\ntates capillary and wetting forces and also represent if the AM process is\\na diffusion based process or convention based. From [ 32], surface ten-\\nsion number is de ﬁned as,\\nS¼dγ=dTðÞ qd\\nμvkð3:5Þ\\nwhere ( dγ/dT) is the thermal surface tension gradient, qis the laser ﬂux,\\ndis the spot size, μis the dynamic viscosity of the melt, vis the scan\\nspeed and kis the material thermal conductivity near its melting point.\\nFor S ≤45,000, surface tension is negligible. This is one of the recom-\\nmended non-directional parameters which is closely related to\\nMarangoni number [ 38,61]. In the literature, surface tension gradient\\nand melt viscosity data is only readily available for pure iron, whereasviscosity estimates may be available for alloys via a generalization of\\nthe Andrade equation [ 62–64]. A tenuous approximation of surface ten-\\nsion is possible via thermodynamic approaches [ 65], however as atmo-\\nspheric interaction is expected to be very signi ﬁcant (for both O\\n2&N 2)\\n[38,61,65,66], accurate estimations should include atmosphere data\\nwhich is not readily available. Unfortunately, signi ﬁcance of surface ten-\\nsion cannot be adequately/comprehensively evaluated from the litera-ture due to the factors mentioned above.\\nFig. 7.

Dimensionless heating depth ratio (HDR)\\nTo incorporate material properties and the heat penetration\\ndepth that would represent the keyhole depth into the analysis, the\\nauthors propose a new combined number called “dimensionless\\ndepth ”. The one dimensional transient model is formulated as:\\n[67,68],\\nTz ;tðÞ ¼Pβ\\nAkﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\\n4αtp\\niefczﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\\n4αtp/C20/C21\\nð3:6Þ\\nwhere Ais spot area, zis distance from surface, tis laser interaction\\ntime, αis thermal diffusivity, zis vertical axis, Pis laser power, kis\\nthermal conductivity and βis absorption factor. While, 90% of tem-\\nperature change occurs within 1 scaling parameter of surface [ 67],\\nthe interaction time can be expressed by d/vwhere dis the spot\\nsize diameter [ 61]. The heating depth can be obtained when the\\nlimit of Eq. (3.6) approaches zero. This results in the following equa-\\ntion representing the heat penetration depth:\\nHeatedDepth ¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\\n4αd\\nvr\\nð3:7Þ\\nA logical dimensionless combined process parameter may be pro-\\nposed through a ratio of the above equation and layer thickness, leading\\nto a parameter so-called heating depth ratio (HDR).\\nHDR¼ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\\n4αd\\nvr\\nlð3:8Þ\\nThe relative density versus HDR data from the literature is plotted in\\nFig. 10 a. From the data available in the literature, it is apparent that, all\\nsuccessful authors are operating with heating depth greater than layerthickness. Therefore, an HDR of 1.5 appears to be a good guideline for\\nfull density parts, as shown in Fig. 10 a. Also the low part density at\\nhigh VED generally correlates with large HDR (long interaction times)as seen in Fig. 10 ba n dc . Fig. 10 c zooms into a narrower range of HDR.\\nFrom the Fig. 10 b and c, it is seen that the central trend VED require-\\nment appears to increase with increasing HDR [ 37]. There are however,\\na few outliers (reported density approximately above 99%) that may be\\nattributed to the fact that the operating in a signi ﬁcantly different mode\\nwith respect to hatch spacing [ 26].\\n4.1.5. Drying time (BJ process)\\nIn the BJ process, after printing of each powder layer, the print\\nbed needs some time to be dried using resistive heater, known as\\n‘drying time’ . To prevent blocking at the print head, it simulta-\\nneously shifts to a clean tank to remove extra binder materials. Ifthe drying time is not adequate, print head may be blocked, which\\nsigniﬁcantly reduces the surface quality of the ﬁnal part [ 24]. More-\\nover, as demonstrated in Fig. 11 , at short drying time, binder inﬁ l-\\ntrates only into the top thin layer leaving more pores in the green\\npart, which leads to a higher porosity and a higher shrinkage in the\\nsintering process [ 24]. Drying time should be long enough to achieve\\nsatisfactory green strength [ 69].\\nAs depicted in Fig. 12, a drying time ranging from 10 to 20s is ad-\\nequate to promote suf ﬁcient green strength and higher relative den-\\nsities compared to the 60s drying time. Moreover, excessive drying\\ntime causes higher solidi ﬁcation and shrinkage rate, which eventu-\\nally increases the production time and electric power consumption[24].\\nHowever, drying time is also determined by the choice of binder. For\\nexample, diethylene glycol (DEG) binders have a longer drying time of\\nabout 30s/layer, while phenolic binders do not require drying. There-\\nfore, drying time ( t\\nd)i sd e ﬁned as a function of powder thermal conduc-\\ntivity ( k), binder saturation ( S), and surface area ( A), as expressed in\\n40%50%60%70%80%90%100%\\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30Normalized density (material basis)\\nSpecific energySpotJ/mm2LPB\\nPure Iron - Rombouts & Mercelis 2006\\nPure Iron - Simchi & Pohl 2003\\nPure Iron - Simchi 2006\\nPure Iron - Song & Codette 2014\\nAISI 1033 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nAISI 1050 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nAISI 1075 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nFe-0.8C - Rombouts & Mercelis 2006\\nFe-0.8C - Simchi 2006\\nHY100 - Dilip & Stucker 2017\\nH13 - Mertens & Van Hmbeeck\\nH13 - Laakso & Ruusuvuouri 2016\\nH13 - Masure & Brandt 2016\\nM2 - Simchi 2006\\nAISI 316 - Simchi 2006\\nAISI 316 - Sun 2016\\nAISI 316 - Wang 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Kempen 2011\\nMaraging 300 - Casalino 2015\\nMaraging 300 - Yasa 2010\\nMaraging 300 - Tan 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Koutny 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Casavola 2008\\nMaraging 300 - Becker 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Du 201640%50%60%70%80%90%100%\\n0 200 400 600Normalized density (material basis)\\nVEDHatch J/mm3LPBPure Iron - Rombouts & Mercelis 2006\\nPure Iron - Simchi & Pohl 2003\\nPure Iron - Simchi 2006\\nPure Iron - Song & Codette 2014\\nAISI 1033 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nAISI 1050 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nAISI 1075 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nFe-0.8C - Rombouts & Mercelis 2006\\nFe-0.8C - Simchi 2006\\nHY100 - Dilip & Stucker 2017\\nH13 - Mertens & Van Hmbeeck\\nH13 - Laakso & Ruusuvuouri 2016\\nH13 - Masure & Brandt 2016\\nM2 - Simchi 2006\\nAISI 316 - Simchi 2006\\nAISI 316 - Sun 2016\\nAISI 316 - Wang 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Kempen 2011\\nMaraging 300 - Casalino 2015\\nMaraging 300 - Yasa 2010\\nMaraging 300 - Tan 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Koutny 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Casavola 2008\\nMaraging 300 - Becker 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Du 20161(a) \\n10(b) \\n40%50%60%70%80%90%100%\\n0 200 400 600Normalized density (material basis)\\nVEDSpotJ/mm3LPBPure Iron - Rombouts & Mercelis 2006\\nPure Iron - Simchi & Pohl 2003\\nPure Iron - Simchi 2006\\nPure Iron - Song & Codette 2014\\nAISI 1033 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nAISI 1050 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nAISI 1075 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nFe-0.8C - Rombouts & Mercelis 2006\\nFe-0.8C - Simchi 2006\\nHY100 - Dilip & Stucker 2017\\nH13 - Mertens & Van Hmbeeck\\nH13 - Laakso & Ruusuvuouri 2016\\nH13 - Masure & Brandt 2016\\nM2 - Simchi 2006\\nAISI 316 - Simchi 2006\\nAISI 316 - Sun 2016\\nAISI 316 - Wang 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Kempen 2011\\nMaraging 300 - Casalino 2015\\nMaraging 300 - Yasa 2010\\nMaraging 300 - Tan 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Koutny 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Casavola 2008\\nMaraging 300 - Becker 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Du 201610(c) \\n40%50%60%70%80%90%100%\\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180Normalized density (material basis)\\nVEDHatch/ ∆H, dimensionlessLPBPure Iron - Rombouts & Mercelis 2006\\nPure Iron - Simchi & Pohl 2003\\nPure Iron - Simchi 2006\\nPure Iron - Song & Codette 2014\\nAISI 1033 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nAISI 1050 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nAISI 1075 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nFe-0.8C - Rombouts & Mercelis 2006\\nFe-0.8C - Simchi 2006\\nHY100 - Dilip & Stucker 2017\\nH13 - Mertens & Van Hmbeeck\\nH13 - Laakso & Ruusuvuouri 2016\\nH13 - Masure & Brandt 2016\\nM2 - Simchi 2006\\nAISI 316 - Simchi 2006\\nAISI 316 - Sun 2016\\nAISI 316 - Wang 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Kempen 2011\\nMaraging 300 - Casalino 2015\\nMaraging 300 - Yasa 2010\\nMaraging 300 - Tan 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Koutny 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Casavola 2008\\nMaraging 300 - Becker 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Du 2016(d) \\nFig. 9.

Thus, powders with poor thermal conductivity, higher binder\\nsaturation, and larger surface area need longer drying time ( td)[70].\\ntd∝SA\\nkð3:9Þ\\n4.1.6. Printing saturation (BJ process)\\nPrinting saturation or binder saturation in BJ is the ratio of air space\\nbetween powder particles ( Vair) and binder volume ( Vbinder)[24,72]. In\\nsimple words, saturation explains the amount of binder to be deposited\\nin the period of printing, and it determines the printing quality and ﬁnalsintered density, which is de ﬁned by the following equations [ 24,72].\\nS¼Vbinder =Vair ð3:10Þ\\nVair¼1−PR\\n100/C18/C19\\n/C2Vsolid ð3:11Þ\\nwhere Vsolidis the volume of solid particles in a de ﬁned envelope. Here,\\nPR is the packing density of the powder bed, as de ﬁned below, [ 24].\\nPR¼Vpowder\\nVpowder þVairð3:12Þ\\nTherefore, optimal binder saturation is selected based on powder\\npacking factor and wettability [ 70]. In order to yield suf ﬁcient green\\npart strength and quality, satisfactory binder saturation is needed [ 72].\\nIf not satisfactory, some powders fall off from the part, leading to abad surface quality (zigzag surface), as shown in Fig. 13 a[24]. On the\\nother hand, low level saturation can result in inaccurate geometry andlow sintered density leaving porosity after binder burn-out. The exces-\\nsive powder bonded to the surface makes some swells on the surface\\nleading to bad surface roughness as depicted in Fig. 13 b.\\nOversaturation also leads to unwanted wetting of the bed, thus stick-\\ning powders to the roller and subsequent inhomogeneous powder bed\\n[70,72]. It has been shown that spherical particles use binders more ef-\\nﬁciently by having small necking area between particles leading to com-\\nparatively low binder saturation levels [ 72]. Our review shows that\\ncompared to the 3D printed bio-implants, which are designed to pos-sess higher porosity, lower binder saturation level gives rise to higher\\nrelative density for ferrous alloys. The effect of printing saturation on\\nrelative density for the 3D printed parts is shown in Fig. 14 ; however,\\nwe do not have enough data points to be able to draw a concrete conclu-sion for ferrous alloys.\\n4.2. Common key process parameters for all three AM processes4.2.1. Powder characteristics\\nPowder properties such as ﬂowability, compressibility, tap density,\\nsize, shape, distribution, etc. have signi ﬁcant effects on the ﬁnal AM\\nmade parts [ 73,74]. Most research studies on the LPB processing of\\nmaraging steels have been focused on the use of gas atomized powders\\nthat are usually expensive. Hoeges et al. [ 75] investigated the impact of\\ndifferent atomization methods on the quality of LPB processed parts.They employed high-pressure water atomization to produce maraging\\nsteel (Ni 17 –19, Co 8.5 –9.5, Mo 4.5 –5.2, Ti 0.6 –0.8, Al 0.05 –0.15, C ≤\\n0.03, Cr, Cu ≤0.5, Si, Mn ≤0.1, S,P ≤0.01 wt%) with niobium instead of ti-\\ntanium. It is bene ﬁcial to replace titanium with niobium, because of its\\nlower af ﬁnity to oxygen preventing the formation of stable solid oxides\\nwhich tend to adhere to the pouring nozzle. Moreover, it optimizes the\\nﬂowability of maraging steel, and minimizes oxide inclusions during the\\nLPB process. The detail of the formation of oxide inclusions due to theoxide contamination of the powder is focused in LPB processed 17-4\\n40%50%60%70%80%90%100%\\n02468 1 0 1 2 1 4Normalized density (material basis)\\nHDR=√(4 /)/lLPBPure Iron - Rombouts & Mercelis 2006\\nPure Iron - Simchi & Pohl 2003\\nPure Iron - Simchi 2006\\nPure Iron - Song & Codette 2014\\nAISI 1033 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nAISI 1050 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nAISI 1075 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nFe-0.8C - Rombouts  & Mercelis 2006\\nFe-0.8C - Simchi 2006\\nHY100 - Dilip & Stucker 2017\\nH13 - Mertens & Van Hmbeeck\\nH13 - Laakso & Ruusuvuouri 2016\\nH13 - Masure & Brandt 2016\\nM2 - Simchi 2006\\nAISI 316 - Simchi 2006\\nAISI 316 - Sun 2016\\nAISI 316 - Wang 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Kempen 2011\\nMaraging 300 - Casalino 2015\\nMaraging 300 - Yasa 2010\\nMaraging 300 - Tan 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Koutny 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Casavola 2008\\nMaraging 300 - Becker 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Du 2016HDR>1.5 (a) \\n0102030405060708090\\n02468 1 0 1 2 1 4VED / ∆H\\nHDRLPBPure Iron - Rombouts & Mercelis 2006\\nPure Iron - Simchi & Pohl 2003\\nPure Iron - Simchi 2006\\nPure Iron - Song & Codette 2014\\nAISI 1033 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nAISI 1050 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nAISI 1075 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nFe-0.8C - Rombouts  & Mercelis 2006\\nFe-0.8C - Simchi 2006\\nHY100 - Dilip & Stucker 2017\\nH13 - Mertens & Van Hmbeeck\\nH13 - Laakso & Ruusuvuouri 2016\\nH13 - Masure & Brandt 2016\\nM2 - Simchi 2006\\nAISI 316 - Simchi 2006\\nAISI 316 - Sun 2016\\nAISI 316 - Wang 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Kempen 2011\\nMaraging 300 - Casalino 2015\\nMaraging 300 - Yasa 2010\\nMaraging 300 - Tan 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Koutny 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Casavola 2008\\nMaraging 300 - Becker 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Du 2016\\nParabolic\\nLinearDot size shows relative density\\n99.7% Density\\n66% Density\\n05101520253035404550\\n01234VED / ∆H\\nHDRLPB Pure Iron - Rombouts & Mercelis 2006\\nPure Iron - Simchi & Pohl 2003\\nPure Iron - Simchi 2006\\nPure Iron - Song & Codette 2014\\nAISI 1033 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nAISI 1050 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nAISI 1075 - Nakamoto & Inui 2009\\nFe-0.8C - Rombouts & Mercelis 2006\\nFe-0.8C - Simchi 2006\\nHY100 - Dilip & Stucker 2017\\nH13 - Mertens & Van Hmbeeck\\nH13 - Laakso & Ruusuvuouri 2016\\nH13 - Masure & Brandt 2016\\nM2 - Simchi 2006\\nAISI 316 - Simchi 2006\\nAISI 316 - Sun 2016\\nAISI 316 - Wang 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Kempen 2011\\nMaraging 300 - Casalino 2015\\nMaraging 300 - Yasa 2010\\nMaraging 300 - Tan 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Koutny 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Casavola 2008\\nMaraging 300 - Becker 2016\\nMaraging 300 - Du 2016\\nParabolic\\nLinearDot size shows relative density\\n68% Density99.7% Density (b) \\n(c) \\nFig. 10.

The researchers addressed the major drawbacks associ-\\nated with water atomized powder characteristics including irregular\\nparticle shape, lower tap densities, and oxidized surfaces. More impor-\\ntantly, there is a slight difference in the avalanche angle between\\nwater atomized and gas atomized maraging steel powder (1°). The\\nsmaller the avalanche angle, the better the processability of the powder;\\ntherefore, the powder will spread more smoothly during the deposition\\nof a thin powder layer [ 75]. It should be noted that water atomized pure\\niron powder (WA-Fe-Powder) with avalanche angle of ~54° has shownsufﬁcient ﬂowability to be processed with additive manufacturing ma-\\nchines, and is documented as a minimum requirement for the process-ability in LPB. In addition, Latenneur et al. [ 73], worked on WA-Fe based\\npowder using the LPB process, where process parameters were opti-mized to improve density and mechanical properties of the 3D printed\\nparts. While gas atomized maraging steel has been most widely used\\nfor additive manufacturing [ 75,77], there are not many papers associ-\\nated with water atomized powders. Nevertheless, the mechanical prop-erties of the water as well as gas-atomized powders for a few steel alloys\\nare compared in Table 1 [75].In the BJ process, powder characteristics such as particle size, mor-\\nphology, density, tap density, and ﬂowability affect the ﬁnal properties\\nof the AM components. For example, spherical particles are mostly pre-ferred, although irregular particles are able to improve green strength\\nwithout achieving uniform density. Furthermore, in order to reach\\ngood packing of powder layers and high green density, tap density of\\nthe powder should be satisfactory. Insuf ﬁcient tap density leads to\\nhigh porosity levels in the green components and subsequent high\\nshrinkage during sintering, which makes it dif ﬁcult to reach desired\\ndensity and tolerances of the ﬁnal component [ 78].\\nThe powder particle size distribution (PSD) has a signi ﬁcant in ﬂu-\\nence on the entire BJ process from making green parts to post process-ing. Dourandish et al. [ 69] showed that sintering behavior of complex-\\nshaped biomedical parts of 316 L SS signi ﬁcantly depends on the PSD.\\nSolid state sintering governs the densi ﬁcation of 316 L SS powders.\\nHowever, using ﬁne 316 L powder, after sintering the total amount of\\nporosity is low (~12%) with relatively small pores. When coarse 316 L\\nparticles are used, a higher total porosity (~20%) with a signi ﬁcant\\namount of large (~100 –300μm) pores is observed. Moreover, the\\namount of carbon pick-up during de-bonding and sintering depends\\non the powder particle size. The amount of carbon pick-up for ﬁne pow-\\nder is 0.2 wt% compared to 0.07 wt% for coarse powders, which is attrib-uted to the lower layer thickness and lower amount of binder used for\\n3D printing [ 69].\\n4.2.2. Layer thickness/layer slicing strategy\\nIn steel alloys fabricated by LPB, higher layer thickness causes a de-\\ncrease in relative density as extracted from published sources andshown in Fig. 15 . Consequently, layer thickness in ﬂuen\\nces the macro-\\nhardness together with the scan speed [ 77,79,80]. To make the plot\\nmore representative, different color is used to focus different laser\\npower, scanning speed, etc.; however, the plot is normalized around\\nlayer thickness.\\nSome studies have been carried out to control the three-dimensional\\ndeposition by the LPF technique [ 32,89–91]. It is known that if the pro-\\ncess parameters are not completely optimized, the ﬁnal layer thickness\\nmight be dissimilar to the original setting value, even with the use of\\nheight control device. To ﬁnd out the impact of process design parame-\\nters on the layer thickness of H13 tool steel, actual layer thickness was\\nmeasured. The dissimilarity in the ﬁnal layer thickness from the setting\\nvalues in terms of thickness error distribution is shown in Fig. 16 a. It is\\nseen that to achieve a good dimensional accuracy in H13 tool steel,\\nlayer thickness might be ﬁxed as 0.254 or 0.381 mm. Also according to\\nresults shown in Fig. 16 b, superior dimensional accuracy can be ob-\\ntained by high powder mass feed rate. Therefore, in this process, both\\nlayer thickness and porosity greatly depend on powder mass feed rate\\nand overlap percentages with a constant laser input power.020406080100\\n0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 0Relative density (%)\\nDrying time (s)BJ\\n316 SS, Zhou (2015)\\n316 SS, Tang (2016)\\n316 SS, Dourandish (2007)\\n316 SS, Ziaee (2017)\\nFig. 12.

How-\\never, in case of de ﬁciency of energy input, the overlap of the melted\\ntrack should be N50% [ 90]. By contrast, in another research, it is claimed\\nthat 40% overlap in H13 tool steel gives the best combination of layer\\nthickness and maximum volume of deposition rate [ 91]. It has been re-\\nported that the layer thickness in LPF fabricated products shows a keyrole in the ﬁnal parts microstructure. In particular, for H13, by increasing\\nthe layer thickness or speci ﬁc energy, the primary dendrite widths are\\nenhanced. In addition, the ﬁner grain and the higher cooling rates can\\nbe obtained by a lower speci ﬁc energy, lower layer thickness but by a\\nhigher speed [ 91]. For H13 tool steel, it is then shown a progressive re-\\nlationship among the outputs of layer thickness and speci ﬁce n e r g y\\nwith powder mass feed rate [ 91].\\nAn interesting strategy to achieve dimensional accuracy is by layer\\nslicing. In the LPF process, the CAD design part is sliced into parallel\\nlayers and synthesized in a layer-wise method. This method is only ap-\\nplicable to surfaces where normal vectors are not aligned to 0° or 90°\\nwith the process direction. Therefore, in spite of a feasible solution of\\nthis method, the staircase effect (a surface with step-like features) still\\nremains [ 92]. There are some studies re ﬂecting on the slicing procedure\\nto reduce staircase effects, such as the volumetric difference betweenlayers [ 93] and controlling layer thickness [ 94]. However, these\\nmethods are considered for ﬁxed direction deposition processes and\\ndo not entirely remove the staircase effect. There are other methodolo-\\ngies such as, multi-axis processing to minimize the staircase effect. In\\nthis method the slicing direction rotates to 90°, in case of an overhang\\nstructure instead of taking the classical parallel slicing procedure\\n[95,96].\\nIt has been reported that layer thickness in BJ is the most critical fac-\\ntor that affects the integrity of the part. It also determines the possibility\\nto design of smallest feature size [ 24]. High layer thickness results in un-\\nbounded layers, while applying a thin layer leads to pushing away of the\\nprinted layers during spreading of the next powder layer [ 69]. Gener-\\nally, it is believed that better end-product properties are achievedwhen applying a low layer thickness, while building time will consider-\\nably increase as a tradeoff [ 24]. It is also reported that layer thickness\\nmust be bigger than the diameter of the largest particle [ 70] or at least\\none diameter of the largest particle in the powder feedstock [ 15]. In\\nthis review, layer thickness/average particle size is de ﬁned as one ofthe key parameters that need to be identi ﬁed and controlled; however,\\nthe capability of the BJ machine constrains the choice of the layer thick-\\nness. Our review shows that higher relative densities are attained when\\nthe ratio of layer thickness to average particle size is in the range of 2.3\\nto 3.3, as shown in Fig. 17 . It should be noted that to reach a ﬁrm conclu-\\nsion more data points are necessary.\\n4.3. Speci ﬁc\\n process parameter for BJ\\n4.3.1. Binder burnout and sintering\\nThe binder used in BJ AM technique is typically a glycerol based\\nbinder, which mainly occupies the interstitial spaces among the powder\\nparticles to hold the powder together in the desired shape. In the post-\\nprocessing step, green part is subjected to binder burnout followed by\\nsintering process, normally in a single step. Particle size distribution\\nand alloy chemistry have a direct impact on sintering kinetics. In\\nsolid-state sintering, particle diameter is the main governing factor\\n[70]. Conversely, in super solidus liquid-phase sintering regime, both\\nparticle diameter and liquid volume fraction control the sintering kinet-ics. Liquid volume fraction is the overriding factor. The alloy chemistry is\\nas i g n i ﬁcant factor in selecting the optimized process temperature [ 70].\\nIt is important to determine a correct sintering set temperature to ob-tain full density and suf ﬁcient mechanical properties.

This setting decreases the level of\\nCr loss from the surface, and preserves the corrosion resistance of the\\nsteel. In addition, sintering at high temperature leads to the formation\\nof delta-ferrite, which is favorable for mechanical performance and cor-\\nrosion resistance. After cooling, some residues of ferrite remain in the\\nmaterial; however, the impact of the low amount of delta-ferrite (up\\nto 8%) is somewhat negligible. To yield higher densities, the sinteringtemperature could be increased, but this is not generally recommended\\nas the higher temperature might affect tolerances. In this review,\\nsintering temperature/melting temperature (T/T\\nm)i sd e ﬁned as a key\\nparameter for post-processing of components processed through binderjetting 3D printing. From the review work as plotted in Fig. 18 ;i ti s\\nstated that higher relative densities are achieved when the T/T\\nmis in\\nthe range of 0.8 –1, with the highest relative density of 99.8 attained at\\nT/Tm= 0.89. Vacuum sintering is another option to improve the ﬁnal\\ndensity by eliminating trapped air inside the samples [ 98].\\n4.3.2. Sintering additives\\nIn BJ, it is known that incorporation of sintering additives into the\\nbase material enhances the densi ﬁcation and ﬁnal structural integrity\\n[97]. Sun et al. [ 99] demonstrated the effectiveness of adding silicon ni-\\ntride (Si3N4) on density, dimensional accuracy, and mechanical proper-ties for 3D printing processed 420 SS in a series of sintering conditions.\\nFrom their work, it is evident that the 3D printed parts with additives\\ncan achieve a high relative density (~98%) and excellent mechanical\\nproperties (~200 GPa) with a slight distortion after sintering at 1300\\n°C. However, because of the large amount of silicon nitride (12.5 wt%\\n~28 vol%), the part is not considered to be a 420 SS anymore.\\nAmong the various sintering additives, boron (B), carbon (C), and ni-\\ntrogen (N) are the most effective elements to reduce the liquidus tem-\\nperature, as shown in Fig. 19 [98]. For example, addition of 4 wt% B in\\niron (Fe) can reduce the eutectic point to 1174 °C in Fe-B phase diagram[98]. The sintering process is enhanced by the transformation of a solid\\nto a liquid phase. With the adequate volume of liquid phase in the greenpart, sintering temperature is reduced and the sample density is im-\\nproved whereas the excessive formation of liquid phase substantially\\ndestroys the sample shape. In powder mixture of SS and B, the liquid\\nphase starts to occur from the location of high concentration of B and\\ndissolves the neighboring SS powders as the liquidus temperature\\nlowers the sintering temperature. However, the higher concentration\\nof sintering additives causes the formation of extensive liquid phase to\\nlose the intended sample shape and can lead to the formation of pores\\n[97].\\n4.3.3. In ﬁltration of nanoparticles into porous BJ printed parts\\nAnother strategy to improve the density of BJ parts involves the in-\\ncorporation of nanoparticles into the inkjet ﬂuid to ﬁll the void spacesbetween the powder particles. However, nanoparticles may have im-\\npact on viscosity of the binder being jetted to make inkjet deposition\\nchallenging or impossible [ 18]. Following this approach where nanopar-\\nticles behave as a sintering additive, objects with densities up to 86.8%are achieved as void ﬁlled nanoparticles increases the packing factor\\nof the powder bed [ 101]. Addition of metal nanoparticles will improve\\nmechanical properties and dimensional accuracy, decrease the sinteringtemperatures, and offer multi-functional aspects to 3D printed parts; for\\nexample, thermal and electrical conductivity [ 101].\\nThe chosen nanoparticles should be compatible with the composi-\\ntion of ﬁnal parts, thus not negatively impacting the ﬁnal material prop-\\nerties. Increasing the packing factor of the powder bed by incorporatingnanoparticles was ﬁrst adopted by Crane et al. [ 102], where iron nano-\\nparticles dispersed in an organic solvent were employed to improvethe quality of 3D printed 410 SS. Iron nanoparticles are excellent candi-\\ndate for steel parts since addition of several percent more iron nanopar-\\nticles impacts slightly on the part composition.\\nDuring heating, the nanoparticle deposits, and sintering of nanopar-\\nticle toughens the bonds between particles, followed by shrinkage of\\ndeposits, which is schematically shown in Fig. 20 . The differences in\\nshrinkage kinetics between the associated powder and the productscan cause cracks, which can be repaired by reapplying the nanoparticles,\\nthen the newly formed cracks are smaller than the previous ones.\\nIn another attempt, Elliott et al. [ 101]i nﬁltrated 316 L stainless steel\\n3D parts by 316 nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were suspended in\\nwa\\nter mixed with two liquid polymer carriers, diethylene glycol\\n(DEG) or ethylene glycol (EG), and deposited drop-wise to a sintered3D printed binder jetted part. This process depends on pH and molar\\nratio of water and polymers. The higher polarity of DEG compared to\\nEG at a pH level of 11 and a DEG/H\\n2O molar ratio of 1:4 leads to the en-\\nhancement of dispersion and in ﬁltration of nanoparticles in the 3D parts\\nand subsequent increase in mass and density followed by sintering.\\nBailey et al. [ 18] produced a nanoparticle, binder, and powder sys-\\ntem that is more comparable to the BJ process by suspending copper\\nnanoparticles in binder and adding the mixture to the 430 SS powder.\\nNano copper was selected only because it provides contrast with pow-\\nder particles, which helps to distinguish the location of the nanoparti-\\ncles inside the part. The quantity of nanoparticle parent solution is\\ndetermined based on the parent solution's packing factor and targeted\\nfraction of void space between skeleton particles [ 18].\\nHowever, incorporation of nanoparticles introduces dimensional in-\\nstability, because of shrinkage and creep; especially at high in ﬁltration\\ntemperature of steel [ 102]. To minimize creep de ﬂections during in ﬁl-\\ntration, parts were packed with refractory powder; which is also chal-lenging for complex shaped parts. Also, the shrinkage difference\\nbetween the packing powder and parts may cause tearing during\\nsintering. Moreover, at higher nanoparticle contents, a substantial\\nfoaming or void expansion occurs during curing. This is because the\\n020406080100120\\n012345Normalized relative density (%)\\nLayer thickness/average particle sizeBJ\\n316 SS, Zhou (2015)\\n316 SS, Tang (2016)\\n316 SS, Dourandish (2007)\\n316 SS, Ziaee (2017)\\n420 SS, Do (2015)\\nFig. 17.

Liquid metal in ﬁltration\\nAnother route of densi ﬁcation is by the in ﬁltration of liquid-metal,\\nwith negligible dimensional changes. Therefore, in BJ technique, metalparts are usually in ﬁltrated with a low melting point material such as\\nbronze in order to remove residual porosity and obtain full density[97,103]. This manufacturing process counts on capillarity of the\\ninﬁltrant material to be absorbed by pores on the surface [ 103]. Inﬁltra-\\ntion changes the nature of the material while ﬁlling the pores of the\\nprinted material which slightly enhances the mechanical properties in-cluding hardness, elastic modulus, yield strength, etc. [ 17,97].\\nSachs et al. [ 103] made an attempt to fabricate injection molding\\ntooling of 316 SS, where cooling channels were conformal with themolding cavity. They introduced a new technique called “stilt in ﬁltra-\\ntion ”which assures that the channels would be free of in ﬁltrant with al-\\nmost no under-in ﬁltration or over-in ﬁltration of the part and clogged\\npassages. Also in the process, the sample was raised on the top of theinﬁltrant surface, which created a negative pressure in the in ﬁltrant\\ncausing the in ﬁltrant to be kept out of the cooling channels. From this\\napproach, it is assured that passages will not be ﬁlled above somecritical range. During in ﬁltration, channels should be placed horizon-\\ntally, in a way to maintain the capillary rise between parallel walls. Ifthe in ﬁltrant angle with respect to the walls is close to zero, then the\\ncapillary rise is given by the following [103 ],\\nh¼\\n2γ\\nρgωð3:15Þ\\nwhere ωis the spacing between the walls, for the molten in ﬁltrant, his\\nthe capillary rise, γis the surface tension, ρis the density, and ցis the ac-\\nceleration of gravity.\\nCordero et al. [ 104], also fabricated a dense ferrous alloy by in ﬁltra-\\ntion of molten bronze, which showed higher rupture strength by elim-inating stress concentration between the particle necks.\\nThe optimum saturation of in ﬁltrant liquid is signi ﬁcantly important\\nto manufacture a standard green product. If the liquid in ﬁltrant exceeds\\nthe saturation level, dimensional accuracy will be destroyed by the mi-gration of excess in ﬁltrant. On the other hand, lack of in ﬁltrant can cause\\nweak bonding between particles. Therefore, precise estimation ofinﬁltrant saturation is vital for the design of BJ printed parts.\\n5. Potential defects\\n5.1. Cold and segregation cracking\\nCold cracking susceptibility is proportional to hardenability, where\\ncarbon equivalent (CE) is de ﬁned as [ 105]:\\nCE¼%Cþ\\n%Mnþ%Si\\n6/C18/C19\\nþ%Crþ%Moþ%V\\n5/C18/C19\\nþ%Cuþ%Ni\\n15/C18/C19\\nð4:1Þ\\nThe high carbon steel contains a continuous phase like martensite,\\nwhereas in SS, continuous phase is often retained austenite, which pre-\\nvents cracking. Cracking is worst in M2 and H13 steel that can beblocked by preheating to partially or fully suppress martensite forma-\\ntion. In LPB, rapid solidi ﬁcation is insuf ﬁcient to suppress segregation\\nbut generally results in ﬁne microstructure. Also, low melting phase is\\nsufﬁciently discontinuous to avoid segregation cracking. This type of\\nphenomena is observed in high copper alloy 17-4 PH SS [ 106].

LPB introduces tensile residual stresses\\nbecause of the localized input of high laser energy in a very short periodof time, and together with the lower thermal conductivity of the pow-\\nder, a higher temperature gradient is developed near the laser spot\\n[45]. Consequently, the expansion of the heat affected zone is repressed\\nby the neighboring material, which usually causes plastic compression.\\nAgain, during the cooling, the contraction af ﬁnity of the upper layers is\\nneutralized by the subsequent layers, which cause tensile stresses thatare major source of cracking.\\nIn comparison between austenitic SS and low-carbon steels, the for-\\nmer is more sensitive to solidi ﬁcation cracking than the later one be-\\ncause of their lower thermal conduction and higher thermalexpansion coef ﬁcients. Moreover, some contaminants like sulfur and\\nphosphorous have a profound impact on cracking in SS. Table 2 shows\\nthe cracking behavior of different water/gas atomized 316 SS powders\\nlinked with impurity amount. The cracking sensitivity becomes less by\\ndecreasing S + P + Si content. It is also claimed that, a considerable ni-\\ntrogen value is harmful to solidi ﬁcation cracking [ 108].\\n5.2. Porosity\\nGenerally, in AM, it is believed that the tendency of pore formation\\ncan be diminished (or controlled) by optimizing the process parame-\\nters, i.e. laser scan speed or laser power [ 109,110]. There are various rea-\\nsons behind the formation of interlayer porosity including;(i) mismatch between mechanical properties of the underlying layer,\\n(ii) mismatch between thermal elongation due to sharp temperature\\ndistribution in the deposited material, (iii) enclosed gas entrapped in\\nthe melt, (iv) chemical reaction between different feedstock etc.\\n[111 –113]. It was observed that low ductile materials show a greater\\ntendency to interlayer porosity [ 112]. A recent study suggests that spec-\\niﬁed critical level of porosity and gas content in the starting powder has\\na profound impact on the interlayer porosity formation. Choi et al. [ 90]\\nstatistically investigated the pore formation in AISIH13 tool steel andconcluded that the powder feed rate is a considerable factor, in ﬂuencing\\nporosity [ 114].\\nPrimarily two types of porosity are considered: (1) gas porosity; re-\\nsulted from encapsulated gas due to incomplete melting of particleswith internal-porosity, and (2) lack of fusion (LOF) porosity due to\\nvoids that create among unmelted or incompletely melted powder par-\\nticles. The former can be resolved by using powders free of gas porosity,\\nwhile the later can be prevented by complete melting of the powder\\n[115]. It is worth considering that LOF is the most detrimental ﬂaw as\\nit may act as a crack initiator as well as lead to a complete failure. Carefulselection of process parameters should be considered in order to dimin-\\nish crack formation and propagation [ 111,116].\\nTable 3 represents the impact of both laser power and powder feed-\\ning rate of H13 tool steel on pore formation in the LPF process. The re-\\nsults indicate that only powder feed rate is a crucial factor for the\\nporosity formation in H13 tool steel. Also, as seen, in case of higher pow-\\nder feed rate, porosity level can be reduced with increasing the laser\\npower input. It should be noticed that achieving a desirable quality\\ncan be challenging. For example, obtaining actual layer thickness is\\nmore probable at a higher powder mass ﬂow rate, but on the other\\nhand, chance of pore formation is increased [ 90]. By optimizing the\\nl\\nayer thickness of single clad tracks with adequate energy input, the po-\\nrosity may be eliminated. In addition, choosing a suitable overlap be-tween tracks can be another effective solution to reduce porosity.\\nA research work on H13 tool steel demonstrated that with a lower\\nenergy input, the overlap should be N50% [ 90]. In another work on\\nH13, it is pointed out that acceptable layer thickness is b0.7 mm, and\\nthe ratio of energy/mass must be higher than 40 KJ/g to avoid pore for-\\nmation [ 91]. In addition, the higher nominal speci ﬁce n e r g yc a nr e s u l ti n\\nthe lower pore/void formation. Also, Fig. 21 represents the speci ﬁcenergy vs. porosity obtained from the literature on H13 tool steel with\\nrelevant normalized powder feed rate [ 117].

The behavior of porosity in both 420\\nand 4140 low alloy steel has been investigated in several experiments.\\nFor 420 SS, the linear mass density (m\\nd) which is the ratio of powder\\nﬂow rate ( _m) divided by the laser traverse velocity ( v¼d\\nt)h a sb e e nu s e d\\nto identify a proper combination of powder feed rate and laser traversevelocity to result in a fully dense part.\\nFig. 22 a shows that there is an optimal linear mass density, (\\nm\\nd)⁎.A ta\\nlower value, no porosity is observed, and at a higher value, the porosityincreases linearly with increasing linear mass density. For the 420 SS de-\\nposited on a 420 SS substrate, the critical linear mass density is 0.0115 g/mm to arrive at a full density part [ 115]. This optimal amount for 4140\\nSS on a 1045 steel substrate is approximately 0.018 g/mm, as showninFig. 22 b. It can be seen that there are many combinations of powder\\nﬂow rates and laser speeds to obtain a fully dense specimen. Values\\nout of the optimal mass density range lead to lack of fusion porosity\\n[115].\\n6. Microstructure development\\n6.1. General microstructural characteristics in AM ferrous alloys\\nIn both LPB and LPF processes, the manufactured parts are usually\\npass through the complex thermal cycles; (i) rapid heating due to the\\nabsorption of laser energy, (ii) fast solidi ﬁcation of the melted region\\nin the absence of heat source, (iii) substantial temperature gradients,(iv) accumulated heat and (v) reheating/recooling due to the laser en-\\nergy in the adjacent layers/tracks. The frequent re-melting and re-\\nsolidifying progressions are continued when the subsequent layers are\\nexposed to heat [ 10,120,121]. While non-equilibrium thermodynamics\\ngovern the physics of the microstructure formation in LPF and LPB, ther-mal cycle depends upon many process variables, hence predicting the\\nmicrostructural characteristics of AM components, and the impact of\\nprocess parameters on them, is still poorly understood.Table 2\\nIn LPF, cracking behavior of various 316 SS powders related to impurity content, adoptedfrom [ 108].\\nDifferent 316SSpowdersFabricationmethodS+P(Wt%)S+P+Si(wt%)NcontentCracking\\n316 SS-1 WA\\na0.02 2.25 0.047 ✓\\n316 SS-2 WA 0.125 1.445 – ✓\\n316 SS-3 GAb0.023 0.553 0.062 ✕\\n316 SS-4 GA 0.041 0.541 0.09 ✓\\n316 SS-5 GA 0.035 0.475 – ✕\\n316 SS-6 GA 0.044 0.384 – ✕\\naWater atomized.\\nbGas atomized.\\nTable 3Inﬂuence of powder mass feed rate and laser power on porosity in H13 tool steel made by\\nLPF [ 90].\\nLaser power (W) 1400 1200 1000\\nPowder feed rate (g/min) 5 8 11 5 8 11 5 8 11\\nPorosity (%) 0.08 1 1.8 1.3 1.1 3 1 2.5 11111 H.

In other words, the AM proc-\\nessed steel typically show three different regions; (i) interface region,\\n(ii) columnar grain region and (iii) equiaxed grain region. The predilec-\\ntion of microstructure is governed by a crucial control parameter pro-\\nposed by Hunt [ 122], based on related solidi ﬁcation theory; the ratio\\nof temperature gradient Gand the solidi ﬁcation velocity V S, i.e. G/V S.\\nIn an extremely large G/VS,w h e nV Stends to zero, the solidi ﬁcation mi-\\ncrostructure contains planar grains. In a relatively high value, the pre-dominant solidi ﬁcation microstructure would be columnar dendrites\\nand smaller G/V\\nSvalue gives rise to equiaxed grains. In LPB, the heat is\\nmostly transmitted through the formerly deposited layers, and develops\\nthe highest temperature gradient in that direction, which eventually in-\\nﬂuences the formation of directional columnar dendrites.\\nHowever, this may not be the case for LPF as the melt pool transverse\\nangle with respect to the substrate ( θs) can vary from 30 to 70° that can\\nchange the solidi ﬁcation rate by a factor of cos( θs)[32]. If the tempera-\\nture gradient becomes alike in some directions, grains tend to grow in\\nthat directions and become equiaxed. A schematic of solidi ﬁed melt\\npool with different zones is shown in Fig. 23 a. The melt pool consists\\nof equiaxed grains in Zone I and columnar grains in Zone II, alsoshown in Fig. 23 b. The shape and growth of dendrites are different at\\ndifferent layers based on the heat dissipation, as depicted in Fig. 23 b.\\nDuring the LPF process, bottom layer is heated for a long time which\\nmay cause tempering effect and the accumulated heat can result in den-dritic growth. On the other hand, at the top layer because of rapid\\ncooling rate dendrites solidify very quickly and have no time to grow\\ncoarsely. Also in the LPB process, the microstructure developed is com-\\nplex because of continuous re-melting process and the Marangoni effect\\nthat causes different heat ﬂow directions in the same melt pool. This\\nphenomenon eventually creates different grain growth orientations[123]. The higher thermal gradient, i.e. 10\\n6K/m in the LPB process\\ncauses columnar microstructure in most of the materials [ 124]. More-\\nover, in LPB, the temperature gradients are interrupted by thermalconductivity of powder as well as solidi ﬁed zone [ 125]. As the heat dis-\\nsipation through the build direction is higher compared to the other di-rections, solidi ﬁcation in that direction results in anisotropy in grain\\nmorphology and mechanical properties. Also in LPB and LPF, coolingrates tend to be high because the area that laser beam heats up is rela-\\ntively small. Therefore, small heat affected zones and ﬁner microstruc-\\ntures can be obtained in comparison with conventionally cast samples\\n[122,126]. Yadroitsev et al. [ 127] explored that the 316 L SS processed\\nwith LPB presented higher yield strength compared to the forged mate-rials. This statement is supported by Song et al. [ 37], where he stated\\nthat, the better mechanical property of LPB processed samples wasdue to the presence of smaller grains and higher dislocation density, as-\\nsociated with rapid solidi ﬁcation.\\n6.2. Solidi ﬁcation and phase transformation in AM steels\\nThe phase transformation and microstructure development in AM\\nprocessed steels are completely different compared to the conventional\\ncast steels, which pass through slower cooling rates as well as gradual/\\nequilibrium thermo-mechanical processes after casting to obtain more\\nhomogeneous material properties. Austenitic SS, (e.g. 316 L and 304)\\nusually shows a completely austenitic microstructure in AM processed\\nsteel. Sun et al. [ 128] employed a detail microstructural characterization\\nin LPB processed austenitic SS 316 L, where two main phases were iden-tiﬁed as primary austenite (fcc γ) and small amount of retained ferrite\\n(bcc δ) without any formation of martensite. However, Tucho et al.\\n[129] identi ﬁed traces of martensite and/or ferrite phases in austenite\\nmatrix in LPB processed 316 SS. Zhang [ 126] observed complete austen-\\nite phases in LPF of SS 316 L, but some ferrite phase was also observed\\nby Yadollahi et al. [ 130]. Also, in LPB processed austenitic SS 304, similar\\nelongated grains in building direction and complete austenite phasewith no carbide precipitates were observed [ 131]. Similar austenitic\\nphase with columnar structure is reported by Yu et al. [ 132], in LPB proc-\\nessed 304 SS. In this work, the mechanical anisotropy was compared be-\\ntween LPB processed 304 SS and Ti-6Al-4 V alloy, which is related tomicrostructure morphology governed by directional solidi ﬁcation. Dur-\\ning the fast cooling stage involved in LPB processed SS 316 L, the high-temperature ferrite phase was not transformed to a low-temperature\\naustenite phase. This retained ferrite phase eventually strengthens the\\naustenitic matrix. For similar composition of Cr and Ni in SS up to Cr/\\nNi ratio of about 1.5, the solidi ﬁcation microstructure mainly contains\\naustenite phases [ 133].\\nThe microstructure of the conventional martensitic SS fabricated in\\nthe AM process is found to form some austenite phases together withmartensite, which is stated for 17-4 PH SS, maraging steel (18Ni300),\\nand also for the martensitic SS grade AISI420. 17-4 PH steel fabricated\\nthrough the LPB process contains a signi ﬁcant amount of retained aus-\\ntenite with body centered cubic (bcc)/martensite and ﬁne niobium car-\\nbides (NbC) favorably arranged through dendritic boundaries [ 106].\\nAc\\ncording to Cheruvathur et al. [ 106] during solidi ﬁcation of AM 17-4\\nsteel, from the liquid the ﬁrst phase is formed as: bcc/ferrite followed\\nby bcc + fcc/austenite. Also, some MC phases enriched with Nb isformed. When solidi ﬁcation is roughly completed, the fcc turns as the\\nmajor phases, and at the end of solidi ﬁcation, approximately equivalent\\namounts of bcc and fcc phases and small amount of NbC are detected.\\nTable 4\\nInﬂuence of some process parameters on porosity of steels made by LPF.\\nMaterial Resulting porosity Mass ﬂow rate Laser power Speciﬁ c energy Thickness Stability of ﬂow rate Scan speed Linear mass density\\nH13 tool steel [ 90]\\nH13 tool steel [ 90]\\nH13 tool steel [ 117]\\n316 SS [ 118]\\n316 SS [ 114]\\n316 SS [ 119]\\n420 SS [ 116]\\n020406080100120140160180200\\n0369 1 2 1 5Specific energy (J/mm2)\\nPorosity (%)LPF\\nmaxmin\\nFig. 21.

[ 134] worked on LPB of 17-4 PH steel and reported a mi-\\ncrostructure consisting of austenite and martensite phases, with both\\ntwinned and un-twinned regions adjacent to the martensitic grains.\\nThe retained austenite is observed among the martensite plates. Kudzal\\net al. [ 135] and LeBrun et al. [ 136] examined the same phenomenologi-\\ncal phase structure in 17-4 PH SS. During the cooling stages in LPB, the\\nresidual thermal stresses in the material cannot transfer all austenite\\nto martensite, which result in retained austenite [ 136]. Mainly retained\\naustenite forms at grain boundaries, because of the irregular atomic ar-rangement, which stops further growth of martensite [ 137]. Therefore,\\nﬁner grain sizes enclosing more grain boundaries may in ﬂuence the oc-\\ncurrence of more retained austenite in LPB of 17-4 PH SS. Al-Mangour\\net al. [ 138 –140] worked on the LPF processed 17-4 SS, and reported\\non the microstructural phase transformation during shot-peening (SP)and heat-treatment. From their experiment, the retained austenite ofas-built sample passed through the SP process and possessed martens-\\nite phase transformation [ 139]. Their another study also explored mi-\\ncrostructure development at different aging temperatures, wherefractions of retained austenite was observed at 866 K but showed fully\\nmartensite at lower temperature of 755 K [ 138].\\nFor both LPB and LPF processes, maraging steel grade 18Ni-300\\nshows similar tendency to form cellular/dendritic structure and epitax-ial growth of the solidi ﬁed grains [ 77,141]. This martensitic SS has a con-\\nsiderable amount of retained austenite and upon aging precipitation,together with austenite reversion is occurred [ 77,141,142]. The austen-\\nite reversion is expected during long period of aging, because the meta-stable martensite converts to stable austenite. During the aging process,\\nNi is released into the Fe matrix and convoys the conversion from Ni3\\n(Mo, Ti) to further steady Fe\\n2Mo precipitates, which stimulates austen-\\nite reversion [ 143]. Campanelli et al. [ 144] investigated the microstruc-\\ntural morphology in 18Ni (300) maraging steel clad produced on AISI\\n304 substrate in the LPF process. The presence of equiaxed and elon-\\ngated grains also with dendrite morphology were alike to that observed\\nby Casalino et al. [ 88] in the LPB process of maraging steel. Their work\\nrevealed a microstructure with ﬁne martensite phases and a transfor-\\nmation of austenite to Fe-Ni martensite. Austenite reversion is also ex-\\nplored by Krakhmalev et al. [ 145] in LPB processed AISI 420\\nmartensitic SS. The top layer revealed martensite and retained austenitein contrast to inner layer where tempered martensite was present with\\nhigher volume of austenite. The LPB process is a multi-step technique\\ncontaining repeated thermal cycles (melting-solidifying), which then\\nbelieved to cause stabilization of austenite by rearrangement of carbon\\nbetween martensite and austenite. Their selective diffusion result in the\\naustenite reversion and consequent growth of retained austenite. In an-\\nother investigation of martensitic SS SC420 processed in LPF [ 146],\\nshowed tempered martensite with ﬁne carbides and ferrite along the\\ngrain boundary.\\nMertens et al. [ 35] worked on LPB processed H13 tool steel, and re-\\nported a signi ﬁcant observation in microstructure development with\\ndifferent powder bed pre-heating temperatures. The microstructureafter preheating at 200 °C, is comparable to the microstructure obtained\\nwithout preheating which constitutes a martensitic phase as well as\\nretained austenite. After preheating at 400 °C, which is above the mar-\\ntensite transformation temperature will produce bainite; an intermedi-\\nate form between martensite and pearlite. Yan et al. [ 132] also reported\\nmartensitic phases decomposed into α-Fe and Fe\\n3C with retained aus-\\ntenite in the LPB processed H13 tool steel. During LPF of H13 toolsteel, the microstructure morphology is columnar to equiaxed grains\\nand most of the grains contain martensite phases [ 90,91].\\nDuring LPB of a high strength low alloy steel, e.g. HY100 [ 39], the mi-\\ncrostructure in the molten region after solidi ﬁcation is fully austenitic;\\nthat completely converts to martensite (untempered) by rapid solidi ﬁ-\\ncation.

AM modeling for ferrous alloys\\nModeling of AM processes is extremely important for the process pa-\\nrameters optimization and to provide prediction of residual stresses andmicrostructure evolution in 3D printed parts. Three categories of\\nmodels can be found in literature: numerical, analytical and empirical.\\nIn LPB and LPF processes, melt pool formation [ 150], laser particle inter-\\naction process [ 151], temperature, velocity and thermal stress ﬁeld dis-\\ntributions over the process, can be simulated by numerical models\\n[152 –154]. Analytical models take into consideration the physics of\\nthe processes and the process optimization. In the literature, analyticalmodels have been employed to predict the melt pool depth, dilution\\nand the temperature ﬁeld with known values of clad height and width\\n[155]. In their work Fathi et al., used a parabolic equation to build the\\nmelt pool's top surface and the temperature ﬁeld was predicted solving\\nthe heat conduction in substrate based on an in ﬁnite moving point heat\\nsource [ 155]. Tan et al. [ 156], estimated the clad layer geometry based\\non a moving disc heat source model. An ellipse was used to ﬁtt h e\\nmelt pool and the powder catchment ef ﬁciency was calculated as the\\nratio of melt pool and the powder stream area. Most of these modelshave different prediction accuracy, since they have either decoupled\\nthe heat and mass ﬂow interactions in the LPF process or did not take\\ninto consideration the changes of the laser power absorptivity [ 157].\\nHuang et al. have developed an analytical model for LPF that combines\\nthe main physical changes of the whole process with the attenuated\\nlaser power, the heated powder stream and the semi-in ﬁnite substrate\\ntaking in consideration their intensity spatial distribution and concen-tration [ 157]. The original laser beam intensity distribution on substrate\\nis shown in Fig. 24 a, with maximum value of 660 J/mm\\n2,w h i l et h ea t -\\ntenuated laser intensity loss of around 28 J/mm2, by the powder is\\nshown in Fig. 24 b[157].\\nThe temperature ﬁeld on substrate surface, shown in Fig. 24 c, was\\nobtained coupling the attenuated laser beam and the heated powder\\nstream that is considered the moving heat source. Two half ellipses\\nwere used to approximate the melt pool projection geometry on the\\nsubstrate surface, and are displayed as dashed lines in Fig. 24 c.\\nThe modeling and simulation of LPB-AM are mostly based on nu-\\nmerical models, which incorporate multi-physics by means of Lattice\\nBoltzmann method [ 158] or the Lagrangian-Eulerian method [ 159]\\nand cover either the hydrodynamic or the thermodynamic aspects.Empirical modeling are more time-ef ﬁcient [ 160] compared to the nu-\\nmerical models, but are case sensitive, while numerical models requires\\nhigh computation to capture the complex phenomena in the molten\\npool [ 157]. Numerical modeling of the LPB process consists of simula-\\ntions at the micro level (melt-pool modeling) and at the macro level(part-level simulation). At the melt-pool modeling level, multiple phys-\\nics phenomena should be considered: heat conduction, heat convection\\nand radiation, capillary effects, Marangoni effect, photon absorption by\\nparticles [ 161]. Panwisawas and coworkers [ 161], taking into consider-\\nation most of the interfacial phenomena in their model, they derived thetemperature distribution of single-track molten zones. It was demon-\\nstrated that the irregularity of the single tracks increased as the laser-\\nscan speed increased. Regarding part level simulations, analytical and\\nnumerical modeling has been used to study the residual stresses in\\nthe LPB processes [ 162] and to investigate the temperature and stress\\ndistributions in one single layer in LPB [ 163]. Analytical models, do not\\nincorporate the multi-physics, and are less common due to the more\\ncomplex physics behind the LPB AM process. For instance, the model\\nproposed by Knol [ 164] describes the process parameters effect on the\\nresidual stresses and the porosity through a semi-analytical thermalmodel. In their model, the authors build the powder bed temperature\\nﬁeld adding the analytical temperature solution together with the nu-\\nmerical boundary correction solution.\\nAlthough there are many modeling papers for LPF and LPB, the num-\\nber of modeling papers in which the target materials are ferrous alloys is\\nlimited.

Hardness for LPF processed parts\\nIn the literature, clearly distinguished microstructure zones with\\nmicro-hardness have been reported for LPF processed AISI P20 tool\\nsteel [ 170], AISIH13 tool steel [ 91,171,172], AISI 420 tool steel [ 173],\\nAISI 4140 steel [ 174], AISI 410 SS [ 109] and AISI 316 L SS [ 118]. It has\\nbeen stated that for steels, the micro-hardness values of multilayers de-\\ncreases from the ﬁrst deposited layer and then increases towards the\\ntop layers [ 118,174,175] due to the heating up of the previous layers\\nand giving them time to be slightly annealed [ 91]. Furthermore, this in-\\nhomogeneity can be ascribed to the time-changing solidi ﬁcation rate in\\nthe melt zone and a relatively slower rate in the central area. As a result,\\nhigher micro-hardness has generally been recognized at the top and\\nbottom of LPF parts in comparison with the middle region [ 10].\\nInFig. 25 for different kind of steels, the data for speci ﬁc energy vs.\\nthe average micro-hardness is presented, as obtained from the litera-\\ntures. From the Fig. 25 , shown that, H13 tool steel has the highest hard-\\nness among the other steels included in these studies, as expected.\\nBetween the low alloy steels; ASTM/SAE 4140, 4130, and 1045 are\\nanticipated to be the hardest steel because of the higher content of\\nalloying elements, as well as higher carbon content in 4140 and 4130\\n[180]. In another research work on 4140 steel, hardness was measured\\nat different regions of the clad. The hardness value near the substratesurface was an average of 375 HK500, in the middle of the sample was330 HK500 and the very last layer showed the hardness of 386HK500. These hardness values were comparable to other works avail-\\nable in the literature, which associated with the formation of bainite\\nand tempered martensitic [ 181,182]. In other publication, the hardness\\nvalues of the deposited 18Ni (300) maraging steel was found between347 and 350 HV [ 176 –179]. These values are in agreement with the\\nusual microhardness of 18Ni (300) steel after solution annealing heat\\ntreatment, as referred in the ASM Handbook [ 144,183].\\nIn H13 tool steel, the internal part hardness somewhat diminished\\ntowards the center and bottom of the sample because of re-heating dur-\\ning the process [ 91]. Similar behavior was observed for 316 SS, where\\nthe Vickers microhardness values of clad surface intensi ﬁed compared\\nto the inside of the clad, as the clad surface experiences the cooling ef-\\nfect of shielding gas. In addition, for H13 tool steel, hardness values\\nwere similar to that of wrought material. However, for 316 SS clad,\\nthe hardness is much greater than that of conventional cold-rolled ma-\\nterial because of the rapid solidi ﬁcation throughout the LPF process\\n[126].\\nThe impact of inter-layer time interval on microhardness values for\\n316 L SS was obtained according to the longitudinal axis of the samples,where the hardness amounts represent that the single-built set has\\nlower hardness values (185 HV) even in heat treated condition (157HV\\n) compared to the nine-built specimens (215 HV). According to this\\nresearch, the inter-layer time interval and post heat treatment canhave an effect on the microhardness values of 316 SS [ 118]. It is worth\\nmentioning that unidirectional and weaving laser scanning path (USPand WSP respectively) do not extremely in ﬂuence the microhardness\\nof 316 SS, as evident in Fig. 26 . The Vickers hardness values of USP and\\nWSP samples do not show any signi ﬁcant differences. However, as-\\ndeposited samples have higher hardness values compared to the heat-treated (1050 °C for 1 h) ones, which is in agreement with other re-\\nsearches [ 184].\\n8.1.2. Hardness for LPB processed parts\\nA broad range of microhardness values for LPB processed 316 SS can\\nbe obtained by various scanning speeds and hatch spacing, as recentlyreported by Sun et al. [ 128]. The highest value of microhardness re-\\nported at an energy volume density of 101.33 J/mm\\n3was 220 HV\\n[128], while, the annealed SS316 L samples showed a microhardness\\nvalues between 150 and 160 HV. These microhardness values were\\nlower than the ones reported by Saeidi [ 185] (320 HV). As reported by\\nSun [ 128], this difference might be attributed by the amount of amor-\\nphous nano-scale inclusions and the grain size. In particular, smaller\\nTable 6\\nTensile properties of several 316 SS grades processed with LPF and conventional ones.\\nFerrous alloys Process UTS (MPa) YS (MPa) EL (%)\\n316 SS [ 15] Wrought or forged/and annealed bar 586 234 50\\nLPF 758 434 46\\nLPF-perpendicular building direction (Y) 793 448\\n66\\nLPF-parallel building direction (X) 807 593 30\\n316 SS [ 193] Wrought or forged/and annealed bar 578 289 50\\nLPF 661 276 67\\n316 SS [ 194] LPF 579 296 41\\n316 L SS [ 191] Wrought or forged/and annealed bar 480 170 40\\nLPF 540 –560 330 –345 35–43\\n316 SS [ 126] Wrought or forged/and annealed bar 586 241 50\\nLPF 639 558 21\\nPerpendicular building direction (Y) 352 536 46\\nParallel building direction (X) 558 639 21\\n316SS,single-built(as-built) [ 130] LPF 620 –660 405 –415 32–40\\n316SS,single-built(heat-treated) [ 130] LPF 600 –620 325 –355 42–43\\n316SS,nine-built(as-built) [ 130] LPF 660 –685 465 –485 12–20\\n316 SS [ 118,190] LPF 540 –625 330 –395 35–85354045505560\\n02468 1 0HRC\\nAging time (h)LPB\\n460°C\\n480°C\\n490°C\\n500°C\\nFig. 28.

[ 186], showed a correla-\\ntion between the densi ﬁcation level, which depends on the volume en-\\nergy density and the grain size. The researchers demonstrated higherhardness values (281.6 HV) at higher densi ﬁcation level, which resulted\\nin more re ﬁned microstructures [ 186]. At increased energy density, a\\ncoarsening of the cellular dendrites occurs and leads to a decrease inthe microhardness values (267.1 HV) [ 186]. Similar hardness value of\\n280 HV, is observed in LPB processed single tracks in 316 L austeniticSS [187].\\nRecently Rashid and coworkers reported the effect of scan strategy\\non microhardness of LPB processed 17-4 PH SS [ 188]. The highest hard-\\nness value (458 HV) was measured for the samples fabricated with adouble scan strategy compared to the ones with a single scan strategy\\n[193]. This phenomenon was due to the occurrence of lower percentage\\nof retained austenite and a higher percentage of martensite [ 188]. How-\\never, for maraging steel, there is negligible effect of scan strategy on the\\nhardness values, as plotted in Fig. 27 , speci ﬁcally at low scan speeds, and\\nthe same trend is reported for layer thickness [ 77,79,80]. However, at\\nhigher scan speeds, a small drop in micro-hardness values is observed.\\nAging has a signi ﬁcant effect on the hardness values of LPB processed\\nmaraging steel, as shown in Fig. 28 , where at 460 °C, the hardness and\\nthe aging time follow a linear relationship; micro-hardness continuesto increase with time without showing over aging. However, the longer\\naging time has no signi ﬁcant effect to increase the micro-hardness\\nvalues. On the other hand, at elevated temperatures and prolonged du-rations, micro-hardness starts to slightly decrease, which may be be-\\ncause of the austenite reversion and coarsening of the intermetallic\\nprecipitates. During laser melting, the surrounding material and the fol-\\nlowing layers are heated up leading to precipitation reactions, which\\nmay be promoted with micro-segregation accompanied with cellular\\ngrowth. In LPB, the re-melting process is signi ﬁcantly pronounced to in-\\ncrease the micro-hardness of the parts, since a second round of agingtakes place [ 77,80]. On the other hand, age hardening of LPB produced\\nmaraging steel causes an increase in the hardness up to 58 HRC, whenoptimal aging time and temperature (5 h and 480 °C) is selected.\\n8.2. Tensile properties\\n8.2.1. Tensile properties of LPF processed parts\\nTable 6 lists the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (YS),\\nand the elongation at failure (EL) for different grade steels processed by\\nLPF along with reference properties of wrought steels,\\n[15,118,190 –192]. The UTS and YS of LPF parts are mostly greater than\\nthose synthesized from wrought counterparts, which can be ascribedto the higher cooling rate and grain re ﬁnements [ 15,19\\n 0,192]. However,\\nLPF processed steels show lower elongation-to-failure values, which isbelieved to be due to porosity and inclusions inside the products caused\\nby the poor optimized process conditions.\\nFig. 29 a–c shows the speci ﬁc energy vs. UTS, YS and EL values for\\nvarious kinds of SS (316SS vs. 420SS) obtained from the literature. For\\ncomparison, different values of normalized powder feed rate ( ζ)a r e\\nalso indicated.\\nAnother interesting feature regarding the tensile properties of LPF\\nsteels is the building orientation of the parts, which affects the resultanttensile properties of the component. A summary of building orientation\\neffects, e.g. parallel (X-direction) vs. perpendicular (Y-direction), on\\ntensile properties of steels is listed in Table 6 . It is believed that this an-\\nisotropic behavior is due to the occurrence of weak interfacial layers,both in Z- and Y-directions, which provides a simple path for shear\\nbands [ 10,15]. Various cooling rates in these deposition directions\\nmight affect microstructure and mechanical properties.\\nThe laser passing time between each subsequent layer is greater for\\nX-direction compared to the materials built in the Y- or Z-directions. 0100200300400500600700800\\nLPF par.

The mechanical properties of LPF mate-\\nrials are superior to the cast and annealed wrought ones. Interestingly,\\nspecimens constructed perpendicular to build direction possess higher\\ntensile strength and poorer elongation than the specimens build along\\nthe parallel direction. However, this is in contrast with other studies. Ac-\\ncording to the authors, this behavior was the result of the distinct posi-\\ntioning of grains along the tensile loading direction, together with the\\ngrain size and spacing between inclusions [ 108].\\nIn addition to building orientation, there are other two factors affect-\\ning the tensile properties of LPF parts; (i) inter-layer time interval and\\n(ii) the scanning path. The measured tensile properties for single-\\nbuilt, nine built 316 SS and their corresponding cast and wrought mate-\\nrials are listed in Table 6 . It is stated that the YS and UTS of 316 L SS by\\nLPF is higher than their cast/wrought alloys, whether or not heat treat-ment or process time interval are taken into consideration. In addition,\\nyield and tensile strengths of the specimens have been increased by\\nhigher layer-to-layer time interval. However, heat treatment candecrease yield/tensile strength. Nine-built specimens show signi ﬁcantly\\npoor elongation to failure in comparison with the cast and wrought ma-\\nterials probably due to the reasons such as: ﬂaws within the parts, ﬁner\\nmicrostructures and unsteady metallurgical bond between the layers,when the elongation to failures of one-built specimens is similar to\\nthe heat treated ones [ 130].\\nThe impact of scanning path on tensile properties of 316 SS is of in-\\nterest. Fig. 31 represents the tensile data in both as prepared and heat-\\ntreated condition for 316 SS; built by following unidirectional (USP)\\nand weaving scanning path (WSP). From the plot, it is evident that the\\nUSP and WSP as-built specimens have higher tensile strength than the\\nforged parts. However, elongations are signi ﬁcantly lower in compari-\\nson with forged counterparts. The reasons for this behaviour could bethe presence of ﬁner grains resulted from the rapid solidi ﬁcation of\\nthe material in the LPF process. In addition, inevitable internal stress, ox-idation and porosity might be other disadvantages for ductility. As\\ndisplayed in Fig. 31 , the tensile properties are anisotropic for the USP.\\nThe parallel loading direction to the scanning path shows greater tensilestrength compared to the perpendicular one, whereas the elongation is\\nthe opposite. Therefore, it seems that the samples deposited by WSP\\nhave higher performance than the USP and the conventional forging\\nones [ 184].\\n8.2.2. Tensile properties of LPB processed parts\\nInTable 7 , the tensile properties are listed for different steel grades\\nfabricated by LPB techniques along with the properties of the wroughtmaterials [ 125]. Ahmadi and coworkers reported about the variation\\nof the mechanical properties with laser input power, scanning speedand scanning strategy in 316 SS fabricated by LPB [ 200]. In particular\\nthe authors demonstrated that strain and toughness of the samplesare remarkably affected by the laser power. The reason is that as the\\nlaser power increases, greater energy density and complete melting\\nare reached due to the greater particle fusion. Moreover, the high en-\\nergy density reduces the porosity and leads to bigger melt pools, and\\neventually the manufactured products density will be increased. The\\ntensile strength, as well as other mechanical properties are in ﬂuenced\\nby porosity [ 200]. The authors also studied the variation of the mechan-\\nical properties with the scanning direction.\\nTable 7\\nTensile properties of various steels, fabricated by LPB\\nFerrous alloy Process UTS (MPa) YS (MPa) EL (%)\\nIron (electrolytic, annealed) [ 201] Wrought 240– 280 70 –140 40 –60\\nIron (0.004%C) [ 202] LPB 450 380 20\\nIron (0.02%C) [ 37] LPB 350– 410 240 –300 10\\nAISI 1005 [ 203] LPB 305 164 –\\nAISI 1033 [ 34] LPB – 650a–\\nAISI 1050 [ 34] LPB – 800a–\\nAISI 1075 [ 34] LPB – 1150a–\\n4130 –as built [ 149] LPB 1503 ± 69 1344 ± 67 12 ± 2\\n17-4 PH SS ASTM A564 [ 125] Wrought (ST + PA) 1310 1170 10\\n17-4 PH SS [ 136] LPB 1255 ± 3 661 ± 24 16.2 ± 2.5\\n304 SS [ 204] LPB (orthogonal to building direction) 715.5 ± 1.5 568 ± 2 41.7 ± 1.1\\n304 [ 205] LPF longitudinal 710 448 59\\nLPF transverse 324 655 70\\n18Ni-300 M [ 77] Wrought 1000 –1170 760 –895 6–15\\n18Ni-300 M [ 77] LPB 1290 ± 114 1214 ± 99 13.3 ± 1.9\\n18Ni-300 M [ 142] LPB 1165 ± 7 915 ± 7 12.44 ± 0.14\\n4340 [ 53] 593 °C stress-relieved LPB 1289 –1310 1365 16–17\\nHY100 [ 39] as per MIL-S-16216 Wrought Not speci ﬁed 690 –827 N18%\\nHY100 –as built (xy) [ 39] LPB 1200 ± 15 1160 ± 15 6 ± 2\\nHY100 [ 39] direct temper 650 °C-2 h-AC (xy) LPB 880 ± 10 710 ± 30 8 ± 3\\nHY100 [ 39] 900 °C-1 h-WQ + 650 °C-2 h-AC LPB 780 ± 10 690 ± 10 18 ± 2\\nH13 [ 206] LPB 1000 –1200 – 0.9–1.9\\nH13 [ 207] LPB 1370 ± 175.1 1003.0 ± 8.5 1.7 ± 0.6\\nM2 –heat treated [ 36] Wrought 1611 – 1.3\\nM2 [ 36] LPB 1286 – 0.6\\naCompressive, ST: solution treated, PA: peak aged.0 200 400 600 800 1000USP (perp.)USP (par.)WSP (perp.)WSP (par.)USP+HT (perp.)USP+HT (par.)WSP+HT (perp.)WSP+HT (par.)ForgedLPF\\nElongation(%)\\nTensile Strength\\n(MPa)\\nFig. 31.

The enhancement of the tensile strength and toughness is due\\nto the reduction of porosity induced by the cross-hatching method.\\nWang et al. [ 186] also showed that the tensile strength and elonga-\\ntion values of LPB manufactured 316 SS are in ﬂuenced by the laser en-\\nergy density (P\\nvsl,w h e r e Pis laser power, vis process speed, sis\\nhatching space and lis layer thickness). From their work, higher tensile\\nstrength is found in LPB processed 316 SS, compared to the wrought\\none. The strength properties vary with the processing method, process-\\ning parameters and the post-process heating, which affect the micro-\\nstructure [ 125]. Nakamoto and coworkers [ 34], showed that steels\\nwith higher carbon content showed increased values of yield stress.Moreover, for fully dense SLS samples at a given carbon content, the\\nyield stress is higher for those ones fabricated at a lower energy input.\\nThe tensile property of maraging steels fabricated by the LPB pro-\\ncess, correlates positively with relative density, as displayed in Fig. 32\\n(a,b). LPB processed parts show higher strength and hardness values\\ncompared to conventionally aged products, because of the melting\\nand re-melting process. In addition, aging heat treatment leads to anincrease in ultimate tensile strength and Young's modulus through the\\nprecipitation of intermetallics. However, the elongation is signi ﬁcantly\\nreduced by age hardening [ 77,79,83]. As relative density of the LPB proc-\\nessed parts increases, fracture behavior shifts from brittle to ductile.\\nDuctile fracture results from the growth and joining of micro-cavities,\\nwhile brittle fracture behavior is the result of macro-cavities, which\\ngenerated throughout the sintering process without suf ﬁcient energy\\ndensity.\\n8.2.3. Tensile properties of BJ printed parts\\nBinder jetted cellular lattice structures are less stiff with a smaller\\nelastic modulus compared to the LPB/LPF processed lattice structures,\\nwhich is due to the formation of a weak neck connection among the\\npowder particles in BJ manufacturing process and partially sintered\\nmetal powders [ 21,22]. Consequently, these lattice structures are only\\nsuitable for tissue engineering scaffolds that necessitate microporesfor nutrient diffusion [ 21]. Zhou et al. [ 22] introduced Instrumented In-\\ndentation Testing (IIT) to measure the Young's modulus of lattice struc-tural parts made by BJ, and depicted a value of 1.50 and 0.446 GPa for\\ngrid lattice sizes of 1.5 and 1 mm, respectively, which are far from 200\\nGPa for a conventionally processed SS.\\n8.3. Fatigue property\\n8.3.1. Background\\nFatigue is one of the critical failure modes for the effective design of\\nmany engineering materials. Cyclic loading normally initiates cracks by\\naccumulating the plastic damage and subsequent propagation of the\\ncracks [ 208]. Generally, cracks tend to initiate near the surface, where\\nnominal stresses are often higher (e.g., in bending), and where geomet-ric variations at surfaces (such as machining marks, surface ﬂaws,\\nnotches, etc.) cause stress concentration. Also, material defects (suchas inclusions, second-phase particles, voids, micro-cracks etc.) can pro-\\nduce stress concentrations to promote crack formation and failure. Thus,\\nfatigue plays a signi ﬁcant role in the engineering design.\\n8.3.2. Fatigue strength in LPB processed steel\\nFrom the literature, it is already known that high cycle fatigue (HCF)\\nproperties of LPB steels are very sensitive to process-induced porosities\\nwhich in ﬂuence premature failure through the crack initiation mecha-\\nnisms. Fatigue test parameters for some LPB processed steels are sum-marized in Table 8 .\\nZhang et al. [ 209] studied the fatigue properties of LPB processed\\n316 L SS and explored that within a ±30% tolerance limit, porosity\\ndoes not invade the HCF properties. Within the optimum processing\\nlevel, porosity driven cracking may be in ﬂuenced by solidi ﬁcat\\nion de-\\nfects caused by over-melting and under-melting and degrade fatigue re-sistance.

[ 137] studied the strain-controlled fatigue behavior\\nof LPB processed 17-4 PH SS, where four types of samples were consid-\\nered; (i) as built horizontal, (ii) as built vertical, (iii) horizontal + heat\\ntreatment, and (iv) vertical + heat treatment. The strain amplitudes\\nvs. fatigue lives of different LPB 17-4 PH SS is shown in Fig. 34 . For LPB\\nprocessed 17-4 PH SS, solution annealing and peak-aging heat treat-\\nment is favorable for low cycle fatigue (LCF), and unfavorable for HCF.\\nThis is because the associated impurities from the LPB process make\\n17-4 PH SS more sensitive and after heat treatment it became harder.\\nHowever, as the defect sensitivity in LCF process was less obvious,\\nafter heat treatment specimens showed better fatigue property. Also\\nthe building direction showed signi ﬁcant impact on fatigue properties\\nin LPB processed parts. In horizontally built sample, higher fatiguestrength was mainly ascribed by their orientation along the loading\\naxis. In case of vertical specimen, defects were more harmful as they\\ngenerated stress concentration during loading.\\nThe effect of scan speed, porosity and microstructure on fatigue\\nproperties of LPB processed maraging steel AISI 18Ni300 was investi-\\ngated by Santos et al. [ 210]. The result shown in Fig. 35 indicated that\\nfor short lives, fatigue strength in both load control and displacementcontrol is similar. However, for longer life, load control tests show\\nhigher fatigue strength.\\n8.3.3. Fatigue strength in LPF processed steel\\nVery few research works have been done on the fatigue properties of\\nLPF processed steel, among them 300 M steel [ 211], AISI4340 steel\\n[212,213] AerMet100 [ 214] steel are reported. The experimental detail\\nof pre and post heat treatment of various laser cladded steels and\\ntheir fatigue test parameters are listed in Table 9 . The fatigue behaviour\\nof the laser cladded material is not simple because of the formation ofcomplex microstructures with different zones (cladding zone, interfa-\\ncial zone, and heat affected zone) compared to the conventional micro-\\nstructure in steel after heat treatment.\\nChew et al. [ 212] characterized the axial fatigue failure of AISI4340\\nsteel where three types of specimens were designed in: Type1: as-clad, Type2: groove-clad-grind, Type3: extended clad-surface grind.\\nThe fatigue behavior of the substrate together with the above men-\\ntioned cladded samples, is shown in Fig. 36 . In general, laser cladding re-\\nduced the fatigue life, e.g. Type1 specimen has poor fatigue strengthcompared to Type2 and Type3. In Type1 specimen, the as-clad region\\nacts as localized stress raiser to initiate crack propagation and failure.\\nThe surface grounded clad toe region in Type2 specimen also enables\\nto initiate surface cracks with lower propagation rate because of lesser\\nstress concentration, which results in longer fatigue life. Design of\\nType3 specimen reduced the cross-sectional area which improved fa-\\ntigue behavior though it pass through the surface grinding of the ex-\\ntended clad.\\nAISI4340 steel was used as a substrate, where AISI4340 and\\nAerMet100 clads were produced using laser cladding, and a poor fatigue\\nlife was reported in AISI4340 as-clad compared to AerMet100 clad\\n[213].Fig. 37 shows a comparison of fatigue life between AISI4340 as-\\nclad and AerMet100 clad. The reasons for this degradation are summa-rized as: (i) the clad and HAZ region show high hardness and brittle\\nproperties, (2) generation of tensile residual stresses and (3) micro-\\nstructural inhomogeneity, i.e. columnar grains in the clad area and\\ngrain growth in HAZ stimulating inter-granular fracture.\\nDuring laser cladding process, the conversion of ferrite from austen-\\nite is inhibited because of rapid solidi ﬁcation. As a result, a brittle phase\\nmartensite is formed from austenite. Bhattacharya et al. [ 215] stated a\\ndetailed microstructure development during DMD of AISI4340 steel\\npowder. In their work, tempered lath martensite was formed in\\nAISI4340 steel clad.\\nDuring laser processing of steel, heating produced by the successive\\noverlapping tracks will not allow austenite in the earlier track to coolbelow Ms. temperature to form martensite. At the end of the cladding\\nprocess, the substrate will solidify which results in the conversion of\\naustenite to martensite. This brittle and untempered martensite de-\\ngraded fatigue life and showed brittle failure mode in AISI4340 as clad\\nsteel [ 21\\n2 ,213].\\nOn the other hand, AerMet100 showed increased fatigue life com-\\npared to AISI4340. This is because of the following reasons; (1) lowercarbon content of the AerMet100 (0.25 wt%), compared to AISI4340\\n(0.4 wt%), resulting lower hardness in the clad region, and (2) high\\nnickel content produced Fe-Ni lath-martensite which stimulate ductil-\\nity. After post clad heat treatment (PCHT), the fatigue life is improved\\nfor both clad materials, which is because of the recovery of ductility\\nand toughness in that region.\\n9. Metal matrix composites (MMC) in AM\\nMetal matrix composites (MMCs) are manufactured with metals or\\nalloys, reinforced with particulates or ﬁbers of other materials with\\nthe objective of high speci ﬁc strength and stiffness, higher operating\\ntemperature/thermal stability, better wear resistance, improved fatigue\\nstrength and the capability to possess these properties for a particular\\napplications [ 216 –219]. The reinforcement of metal matrix using AM\\ntechnology, opens up the possibility of their application in areaswhere light weight material and cost reduction has the priority, like in\\nautomotive, aerospace, and biomedical industries [ 216 –218].\\nGenerally, MMCs are manufactured using conventional techniques,\\ni.e., casting and powder metallurgy, where some major problems are as-\\nsociated as follows: (1) In casting method, the required molds and the\\n02004006008001000\\n1.E+2 1.E+3 1.E+4 1.E+5 1.E+6 1.E+7Stress amplitude (MPa)\\nNumber of reversalsLPB\\n17-4PH SS-\\nHorizontal AB\\n17-4PH SS-\\nHorizontal HT\\n17-4 PH SS-Vertical AB\\n17-4PH SS-Vertical HT\\nFig. 34.

Com-\\npared to the conventional casting, in LPB and LPF AM, melt poolpass through a non-equilibrium solidi ﬁcation due to fast heating\\nand cooling over a small melt pool area, which lead to ﬁner micro-\\nstructure and homogeneous distribution of reinforcing element\\n[5,222]. Moreover, AM can reduce processing times and cost by fab-\\nricating near net shape with minimum machining and allow to man-ufacture products with complex geometry.\\nIn MMC of ferrous alloys, the common reinforcing element includes\\nphases of carbides (SiC, TiC, WC), nitrides (TaN, TiN), borides (TiB, TiB\\n2,\\nWB), metal oxides (Al 2O3), and carbon ﬁbers [ 139], [217,223,224]. Addi-\\ntion of second-phase carbides into steel matrix can improve mechanical\\nproperties because of their slow growth rate and thermal stability com-\\npared to the cementite [ 217,225]. For example, reinforcement of ther-\\nmodynamically stable TiC in martensitic steel matrix, has proven\\nimproved stiffness, hardness and wear property [ 217]. In laser based\\nAM, the strong Marangoni convection brought by high thermal capillaryforces caused instability in the melt pool. The liquid ﬂow is generally\\nobsessed by gravity force, buoyancy force and surface tension in themolten area. Consequently, the redisposition of reinforcing elements\\nand their subsequent distributions are signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuenced by the\\nﬂuidﬂow.9.1. LPB processed MMC\\nIn literature, MMC manufactured using LPB process is limited to two\\nsteel matrix materials (316 L SS, H13 tool steel) and three reinforced\\nmaterials or ﬁllers: (titanium carbide (TiC), titanium diboride (TiB\\n2)\\nand hydroxyapatite (HA)), as summarized in Table 10 . The as printed\\nrelative density N95% is achieved with TiC and TiB 2but is not reported\\nfor HA [ 216,222,223,225 –228]. Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) treatments\\nallowed a relative density in the range of 99% + for TiB 2, however this\\ndecreased the wear resistance and hardness when compared to the asprinted condition [ 225,226].\\nWhile ﬁller is seen throughout the matrix, it is typically more con-\\ncentrated at solidi ﬁcation cell boundaries forming a continuous net-\\nwork of high ﬁller content regions with a honeycomb like appearance\\n[216 –218,221,223,225 –230]. The presence of well dispersed high melt-\\ning particulate ﬁllers serves as a nucleating agent resulting in grain re-\\nﬁnement. As expected from composites theory, well dispersed nano-\\nﬁllers produce the strongest effects (e.g. 316 L-15TiC [ 216,221,227]).\\nDue to the increased nucleation, MMC matrix grains are also moreequiaxed and exhibit weaker crystallographic texture when compared\\nto un ﬁlled material [ 217,222,227]. Unlike typical LPB builds, columnar\\ngrains in MMC do not extend though the layer due to increased nucle-ation [ 222,223].\\nIn LPB produced MMC, the hardness and wear resistance follow the\\nexpected trends for particulate reinforced composites, namely they are\\nproportional to ﬁller volume fraction and inversely proportional to ﬁller\\nsize. Despite the lower relative densities of MMC, their properties wereconsistently better than un ﬁlled controls.

LPF processed MMC\\nIn LPF, majority of researches have been considered TiC as the rein-\\nforcing material because of their high strength and better wear resis-tance properties, as summarized in Table 11 . The amount of reinforced\\nTiC has a signi ﬁcant effect on the size and morphology of the TiC in\\nMMC. Also, various forms of TiC including, spherical, rod, ﬂower-petal,\\ncubic and dendrite shapes can be formed depending on the laser process\\nparameters [ 231 –234]. It is worth mentioning that TiC particles could be\\nundissolved, partially dissolved and completely dissolved in the steelmatrix relying on laser cladding parameters such as, laser power, pow-\\nder feeding rate, and laser cladding speed. It is found that in most of the\\nresearches on Fe-TiC MMC, defects free coatings can be produced if TiC\\nis completely dissolved in the steel matrix [ 234 –236]. Also, in otherMMC, containing TiB\\n2, SiC, VC, Cr 3C2,A l2O3and ZrC as the reinforcing\\nmaterials, defect free and favorable metallurgical bond between the\\nclad and the substrate has been observed [ 237 –240].\\nThe microstructure of the composite coating is generally planar, cel-\\nlular, dendritic or ﬁne equiaxed grains [ 247,251]. So, laser process pa-\\nrameters show a critical role in the quality and microstructure of thecomposite clad and the interfacial strength between TiC reinforcing par-ticle and the matrix [ 233,243]. Consequently, they can in ﬂuence the\\nwear resistance and hardness of the clad layer [ 232,242].\\n9.3. BJ printed MMC\\nThe process detail of MMC manufactured in BJ technique and their\\nproperties are summarized in Table 12 .\\nKuldeep Agarwal's group at the Minnesota State University adopted\\nBJ AM process to produce porous biocomposites based on SS and tri-calcium phosphate (TCP) with tailored microstructure and mechanical\\nproperties to act as load bearing medical implants [ 254,255]. In their ex-\\nperiment, 316 SS and β-TCP were simply mixed in different volume\\nfractions. After printing and sintering, β-TCP formed a coating on SS par-\\nticles, with higher volume fraction of β-TCP covered more SS particles\\n[254]. 316SS-20TCP and 316SS-40TCP composites represented an elas-\\ntic modulus of 7 –30 GPa, within the range of cortical and cancellous\\nbones. Where, 316SS-40TCP was suited for scaffold applications and\\n316SS-20TCP composite found to be an excellent candidate for implant\\napplications [ 254,255].\\nScheithauer et al. [ 253] reported a thermoplastic 3D printing ap-\\nproach to produce metal-ceramic composites using high- ﬁlled\\niron chromium alloy/17-4 PH suspension and zirconia suspension inmolten thermoplastic binder systems/dispersing agent with powder\\ncontent of 50 vol% steel and 50 vol% zirconia. The process involved pre-\\nparing suspensions in a heatable ball mill and printing of the suspen-\\nsions in a layer-by-layer process, which then solidi ﬁed and passed\\nthrough the conventional de-binding and sintering [ 252,253]. Un-\\nwanted secondary phases such as oxides and carbides were formedand precipitated within the grain boundaries and the grown pore\\nspaces, which could be avoided during heat treatment in inert atmo-\\nsphere (Ar/H\\n2)[252]. This process can be adopted for any materials\\ncompositions, considering similar thermal expansion or shrinkage be-havior of the materials, which leads to the formation of defectless\\nparts with no delamination, structural changes, etc. [ 253].\\nTable 10\\nProperties of LPB processed MMCs.\\nComposite Matrix-Vol% Mixing/heat treatment Filler size Hardness Wear mm3/Nm YS (MPa) Modulus (GPa)\\n316 L-15TiC BM AP 45μm[221] –– 710 –\\n2–12μm[227] 335 –373 HV – 987– 1150 –\\n1μm[216] 385 HV 6.5 × 10−4––\\n50 nm 406 HV [ 216] 6.1 × 10−4814 [ 221,222] –\\n316 L-10TiC IS AP 20 nm [ 218] 342 –386 HV [ 228] 1.4–2.3 × 10−4[218,228] ––\\n318 –415 HV [ 218] ––\\n316 L-10TiC [ 216]B M A P 1 μm 339 HV 7.3 × 10−4––\\n50 nm 364 HV 4.3 × 10−4––\\n316 L-2.5TiC [ 216]B M A P 1 μm 293 HV 9.6 × 10−4––\\n50 nm 295 HV 9.4 × 10−4––\\n316 L-15TiB 2[226]P B A P 2–12μm 568 HV 0.006 × 10−4––\\n316 L-15TiB 2[226]B M A P 2–12μm 617 HV 0.001 × 10−4––\\nBM HIP 2 –12μm 307 HV 1.0 × 10−4––\\nBM 2xHIP 2 –12μm 433 HV 1.6 × 10−4––\\n316 L-2.5TiB 2[226]B M A P 2–12μm 303 HV –– –\\n316 L-15HA [ 229]B M A P b100 nm 2.52 NI – 85 151\\n316 L-10HA [ 229]B M A P b100 nm 2.51 NI – 162 167\\n316 L-5HA BM AP b100 nm [ 229] 2.36 NI – 443 226\\nH13-15TiC BM AP 5μm[230] 241 HV – 50–80 –\\nBM AP 50 nm 306 –858 HV [ 225], 811 HV [ 9] 3.6 × 10−6[9] – 256 [ 9]\\nBM HIP [ 225] 50 nm 345 HV –– –\\nH13-15 TB 2[223]B M A P 2 –12μm 759 HV 1.24 ––\\nBM HIP 2 –12μm 833 HV 1.95 ––\\nBM-Ball-Mill, IN-in-situ, PB-powder blend; AP-As Printed, HIP- Hot Isostatic Press; HV-Vikers, NI-Nano Indentation (GPa).\\n020040060080010001200140016001800\\n1.E+2 1.E+3 1.E+4 1.E+5 1.E+6 1.E+7Stress range (MPa)\\nNo. of cyclesLPF\\nSubstrate\\nAISI4340 as-clad\\nAerMet100 as-\\nclad\\nAISI4340 as-clad+PCHT\\nAerMet100 as-\\nclad+PCHT\\nFig. 37.

Challenges, trends and opportunities\\nMetal AM processes have the potential to produce complex near-\\nnet-shape steel components. Various examples were found in the liter-\\nature, where dense steel parts with acceptable properties were fabri-\\ncated. However, there are signi ﬁcant challenges associated with LPB,\\nLPF and BJ processes; some of the most signi ﬁcant ones are mentioned\\nbelow:\\n1- There is a large number of process/design parameters such as, laser\\npower, powder feed rate, laser traverse speed, layer thickness, scan-\\nning pattern, etc. involved in LPB and LPF manufacturing processes.\\nAs mechanical properties, thermal gradient and consequent micro-\\nstructure of laser fabricated parts depend on the process parameters\\nand interaction among them, it is vital to optimize these parameters\\nto achieve near-net-shape components with minimal defects such aspores and inclusions. Therefore, novel and effective statistical ap-proaches are required to consider all interdependencies of parame-\\nters while a minimum number of experiments is conducted.\\nWithin the context of new statistical approaches, much attention\\nmust be given to such higher-order interaction effects, which lead\\nto systematic uncertainty in the resulting models and experimental\\nachievements. In this regard, choosing the appropriate combined pa-\\nrameters is of vital importance for the statistical analysis as it is eas-\\nier to consider their effect on porosity and mechanical properties of\\nthe AM parts instead of using individual parameters.\\n2- A vast majority of existing studies only investigate optimal process\\nparameters for steels using simulation and/or experimental ap-\\nproach. A signi ﬁcant limitation is that, by changing the experimental\\nconditions (e.g., material, process, system, or environmental condi-tions), the resulting optimal process parameters might no longer\\nbe applicable. Consequently, new experiments are needed to be\\nTable 12\\nComposite detail, process parameters, and properties of MMCs, manufactured in BJ process.\\nComposite Matrix-Vol% ﬁller (method/substrate) Filler (cemented)\\nparticlesize ( μm)Heat treatment YS\\n(MPa)Modulus(GPa)\\n17-4 PH SS-45 TZ-3Y-SE zirconia (suspensions based on heated binder mixture/dispersing\\nagent) [ 252]d50 = 0.3 Two-step de-binding: 270 °C (Air),\\n800 °C (Ar),Sintering-1350 °C (Ar)\\nCrofer22APU/17-4 PH SS-50 TZ-3Y-SE/TZ-3Y-E (suspensions based on heated binder\\nmixture/dispersing agent) [ 253]d50 (TZ-3Y-SE) =\\n0.180\\nd50 (TZ-3Y-E) =0.105Two-step de-binding: 270 °C (Air),\\n900 °C (Ar)\\nSintering-1400 °C (Ar/H\\n2)––\\n316 SS-20 TCP (mechanical mixing) [ 254,255]\\nLayer thickness: 50 μm– Curing-150 °C,Sintering-1200 °C/8 h798.713 –\\n316 SS-20 TCP (mechanical mixing) [ 254,255]\\nLayer thickness: 200 μm– Curing-150 °C,Sintering-1200 °C/8 h786.513 –\\n316 SS-20 TCP (mechanical mixing) [ 254]\\nLayer thickness: 50 μm5 Curing-175 °C,\\nSintering-1200 °C/4 h (Ar)238.16 32.4\\n316 SS-20 TCP (mechanical mixing) [ 254]\\nLayer thickness: 100 μm5 Curing-175 °C,\\nSintering-1200 °C/4 h (Ar)89.39 29.8\\n316 SS-40 TCP (mechanical mixing) [ 254]\\nLayer thickness: 50 μm5 Curing-175 °C,\\nSintering-1200 °C/4 h (Ar)48.8 13.6\\n316SS-40 TCP (mechanical mixing) [ 254]\\nLayer thickness: 100 μm5 Curing-175 °C,\\nSintering-1200 °C/4 h (Ar)31.7 15.7Table 11Properties of LPF processed MMCs.\\nComposite Matrix-Vol% ﬁller/substrate Filler (cemented) particle size ( μm) Hardness Weight loss by wear (mg)\\nTool steel 9OMnCrV8-TiC [ 232] 3 950 HV2 8\\nHeat treated samples:As-quenched– 890 HV2 17\\nTP 180 °C – 790 HV2 38\\nTP 300 °COQ1000°C + twofold refrigerating −196 °C– 1060 HV2 –\\nOQ 1000 °C + twofold refrigerating −196 °C 50–100 600– 860 HV –\\n16NCD13(14NiCrMo13-4); low-carbon low alloySteel-TiC/cast iron [ 234,241,242]−80 + 40 550 HV0.1\\nAt 2.5 vol% TiC–\\nPure Fe-30 wt% TiC [ 243,244] 40 1000 –1400 HVN –\\nFe-TiC/1045 steel [ 236] – 840– 500 HV0.2 0.1 mm\\n3\\nAISI 304 L SS-TiC [ 245] 82 220– 500 HV0.1\\nSteel-20 wt%TiB2/low carbon steel substrate [ 240] – 900 HV0.2 0.24 mm3\\nFe-TiB2composite coating/1010 steel [ 246] 100 700– 1000 HV0.2 5\\nAISI 316 L SS-SiC (5, 20 wt%)/mild steel [ 239,247]2 5 –40 340 VHN (for 5% SiC)\\n800 VHN (for 20% SiC)–\\nFe based alloy-VC/H13 steel [ 248] – 900HV0.2 –\\nFe-VC/1020 low carbon steel [ 237] – 300– 800 HV0.2 0.2 mm3\\nAISI316 –33,50 vol%Cr3C2/SS [ 249] −45\\n/+545–57HRC0.2 (for 33 vol%)\\n52–58HRC0.2 (for 50 vol%)25–35 times improvement (33 vol%)\\n42–88 times improvement (50 vol%)\\nFe-based alloy-10,20%Cr3C2/35CrMo steel [ 250]3 0 –50 650– 680HV0.2 (for 20%) 5\\n(20% Cr3C2)18(10% Cr3C2)\\n304SS-10wt.%Al2O3/45steel [ 251]4 5 –100 600 HV 1.2\\nFe based alloy-ZrC0.7/medium carbon steel [ 238]7 4 –100 1000 –1200 HV0.2 –123 H.

It is obvious from the data in the literature that it\\nis extremely challenging to consolidate the data available due to the\\ninconsistencies in the procedures and methodologies used for\\nextracting data. As the AM community grows, the development of\\nstandard procedures is inevitable to help the community to interpret\\nthe data more effectively and prevent experimental duplication as\\nmuch as possible.\\n3- Building orientation of steel parts fabricated via LPB and LPF may af-\\nfect their thermal history. This is because of the anisotropic heat con-duction along the built direction. As a result inhomogeneity in\\nmicrostructure with elongated grains is formed that eventually\\nleads to anisotropic mechanical properties. Post process heat treat-\\nment may eliminate the anisotropic property, but further investiga-\\ntion and validation of this approach is required. For example, Hot\\nIsostatic Pressing (HIP) can signi ﬁcantly decrease the anisotropy in\\nthe building orientation by removing directional porosities; how-ever, the HIP may cause a detrimental dimensional shrinkage. An-\\nother possible solution that to the best of our knowledge has not\\nbeen considered yet in the literature is cooling of the substrate, for\\nthe sake of tempering, as soon as the AM process is completed.\\nThis would need to be carefully examined and effectively controlled.\\n4- Last but not least, the number of ferrous alloys deployed to AM pro-\\ncesses is extremely limited. While there are N1000 steel alloys for\\nconventional manufacturing (casting, forging, machining, etc.),there have not been many steel alloys deployed to AM by re-\\nsearchers and industry to-date. It becomes a more limiting factor\\nwhen the number of quali ﬁed steel alloys offered by the AM Original\\nEquipment Manufacturers (OEMs) is b10. Further efforts must be\\nmade to develop new steel alloys, which are better tailored to AM\\nand also to deploy existing alloys to AM processes, for which immi-\\nnent market opportunities are expected.\\nAcknowledgement\\nThis study was carried out under the project, ‘Additive manufactur-\\ning of ferrous alloys ’.

Titanium is an attractive choice for many
components in the aerospace industry; how-
ever, its inherently high cost often negates itsuse. A cost-effective, near-net shape, laserforming approach to producing large andcomplex parts has been developed and isbeing commercialized.
INTRODUCTION
The excellent combination of specific
mechanical properties (i.e., normalizedto density) exhibited by titanium alloyssuch as Ti-6Al-4V are very attractive foraerospace applications.
1–3 However, the
high cost of the final components, result-ing from the high cost of producing rawtitanium and processing and machiningdifficulties combined with buy-to-flyratios that average 5:1 and can often begreater than 20:1, result in titanium be-ing used only when it is the only mate-rial that can meet design requirements.There is generally a direct relationshipbetween material cost and volume ofuse; consumption decreases with increas-ing cost. Thus, any process that can re-duce the cost of titanium components isattractive to the aerospace industry.
One such process is the near-net shape
Lasform
SM process4–8 being commercial-
ized by the AeroMet Corpora-tion of Eden Prairie, Minnesota.This process, shown schemati-cally in Figure 1, is a laser addi-tive manufacturing (LAM) pro-cess that combines high-powerlaser cladding technology withadvanced rapid prototyping todirectly manufacture complex,fully dense, three-dimensionalcomponents directly from com-puter-aided design images. Theprocess fabricates shapes fromtitanium powder and targetplates and is performed withoutthe cost of molds or dies. Themajor advantages of Lasformingare near-net shape components,dramatically reduced deliverytimes, greatly reduced machin-ing requirements, enhanced de-sign flexibility, the ability to pro-duce grade chemistries, repaircapability of broken or worncomponents, feature addition ca-Producing Titanium Aerospace

design modifications.
Development of the basic concept be-
gan more than 20 years ago, and techni-cal feasibility and scale-up were demon-strated as part of an R&D programfunded by the U.S. Defense AdvancedResearch Projects Agency, with the Of-fice of Naval Research serving as thetechnical agent.
4 This work, led by Johns
Hopkins University, was conducted overa three-year period with PennsylvaniaState University and MTS Systems Cor-poration, AeroMet’s parent company,serving as subcontractors. The programdemonstrated the viability of rapidprototyping of titanium-alloy parts andthe production of cost-effective compo-nents very close to net shape (requiringonly a final machining operation) withchemistry, microstructure, and mechani-cal properties meeting stringent aero-space requirements.
MTS Systems Corporation designed
and fabricated the full-scale commercialLasform system currently located atAeroMet’s Eden Prairie facility (Figure2). The system is being operated in col-laboration with the U.S. Army ResearchLaboratory’s Aberdeen Proving Ground,Maryland, as part of a three-year coop-erative research and development agree-ment program to further develop, evalu-ate, and validate the Lasform process fordefense applications in a semi-commer-cial mode. Independent investor re-sources have supported the continueddevelopment of the process to the pointof full commercialization.
THE LASFORMING PROCESS
A schematic of the process is shown
in Figure 1, in which titanium powderis fed in a controlled fashion to theworkpiece, where it is melted by the CO
2laser, progressively building up a struc-ture one layer at a time. Thus, for ex-ample, complex ribs and flanges can bebuilt up on a starting plate, dramaticallydecreasing material loss (to machinechips). Typical laser-formed structuresare designed to be 0.762–5.08 mm over-size. These built-up structures can beangled as much as 60 ° from the vertical.
The deposition rate can be controlledbased on heat-balance effects, so thatmetallurgically sound interfaces areformed between each fused powderlayer. Normally, fully dense parts areproduced at a deposition rate of 0.90–4.5
kg per hour. Typical lasformedparts after final machining areshown in Figure 3.
At least four types of precur-
sor titanium powders
9,10 have
been successfully used to date,all in the –40 +325 mesh range:blended elemental (commer-cially pure titanium powder plusAl/V master alloy), gas-atom-ized, plasma-rotating electrodeprocessed, and hydride-dehydride prealloyed powder.Good flow characteristics to theworkpiece are required. Alloysproduced include Ti-6Al-4V, Ti-5Al-2.5Sn, Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-2Mo-0.1Si, and Ti-6Al-2Sn-2Zr-2Cr-2Mo-0.25Si.
The major advantage of the
Lasform process is producingcomplex, laser-formed, near-netshapes (referred to as machiningpreforms) requiring only finalmachining and heat treatment.29 2000 May • JOMFigure 2. The current AeroMet Corporation/ARL Lasform commercial-scale system.
Figure 3. Typical lasformed and machined components.
Conventionally, these parts are produced
by forging, which requires expensivetooling and extensive machining or ahog-out from a large slab or plate of hot-rolled material. The cost for relativelyshort production runs (up to 500 parts)is decreased, and design changes once aproduction run is underway can beachieved much easier. Delivery timesare about 30–60 days as compared to asmuch as 15 months for the forge plusmachine approach.
Post-laser-forming part inspection in-
cludes coordinate measuring machineverification of the dimensions, witnesssamples for mechanical property test-ing, and chemical analysis as well asultrasonic inspection and x-ray radiog-raphy. After final machining, die-pen-etrant inspection can also be carried out.
The Lasform process can also be used
as a feature addition technique in whichlugs or extensions are added to forgings,castings, or extrusions. This allows sim-pler and economical dies and tools to beused and provides more efficient mate-rial utilization. There is also the possibil-ity of repairing broken, mismachined, orworn sections of a component.
LASFORMED COMPONENT
CHARACTERISTICS
The microstructure of lasformed Ti-
6Al-4V consists of relatively fine priorbeta grains that are about the same sizeas those in thin casting. These prior betagrains, which can be columnar or equi-axed, depending on the laser-systemforming perameters used, transformduring cooling to produce relatively thinand discontinuous grain-boundary al-pha and transgranular alpha (Figure 4).The mechanical properties of las-
formed Ti-6Al-4V (post laser-form subbeta transus anneal and age) include839 MPa yield strength, 900 MPa ulti-mate tensile strength, 12.3% elongation,a 23.5% reduction in area, and 104 MPa
  m KIC. As would be expected,1–3 these
are equivalent to the mechanical proper-
ties typical of Ti-6Al-4V cast and wrought(ingot metallurgy) material.
The integrity of the lasformed parts
produced has been found to be as goodas or better than that of cast and wroughtproducts, and these latter are not typi-cally 100% defect free. For example, thepowder-metallurgy approach to produc-ing components from superalloys andtitanium for demanding applicationssuffers from at least the perception thatdefects that will degrade mechanicalproperties can be present. Hence, eventhough superalloy Rene 95 parts havenever exhibited a problem in T700 heli-copter engine parts, near-net shapes arenot allowed; instead, a quality-assur-ance forging step is included in final partfabrication.
Fatigue initiation properties are very
sensitive to the presence of inclusions.Thus, the data shown in Figure 5 arevery encouraging. Here, the smooth S-Nfatigue data for lasformed Ti-6Al-4V areat the high end of cast data, albeit thelower portion of the cast and wroughtscatterband.
1–3 This is probably at the
lower end of the ingot data because ofthe nature of the microstructure of thelasformed material. A finer, more equi-axed microstructure would raise the datatoward the upper part of the cast andwrought scatterband. More recent datashow this improved S-N performance .
THE NEXT STEP
The current AeroMet/Army Research
Laboratory production system is oper-ating at 18–19 kW and allows parts 2.5 mlong × 1 m wide × 1 m in height (up to
nine tonnes in weight) to be producedwith ±0.076 cm reproducibility. A sec-
ond planned unit (scheduled for com-missioning in October) with a 30 kWCO
2 laser will allow parts up to 3.6 m ×
3.6 m × 1.2 m to be produced at projected
deposition rates of 5–7 kg per hour orgreater. A third planned unit, whichcould be the same size or bigger than thesecond unit, will result in a total plantcapacity of greater than 45–60 t/y depo-30 JOM • May 2000Figure 5. S-N fatigue data for lasformed Ti-

Cost savings as compared to conven-
tional approaches are projected to begenerally 15–30%. Under an Office ofNaval Research Dual Use Science andTechnology program, four wing compo-nents for the F/A-18E/F will be fabri-cated using laser forming—the innerwing-splice fittings and the wing-foldfittings.
12 Based on a purchase of 400
aircraft, a cost savings of $50 million isestimated. The prime contractors, Boeingand Northrop-Grumman, estimate thatlaser forming will result in a 75% reduc-tion in delivery time and more thanthan 20% cost savings.
The project’s near-term thrust is toproduce titanium parts for full compo-nent testing, demonstrating cost savingsand reduced delivery times at mechani-cal property levels equivalent to castand wrought levels. Production ordersare expected to follow. In the future,new concepts will be explored, such asbuilt-up structures (unitized structureseliminating fasteners) and structureswith functionally graded compositions(e.g., a disc with optimized low-cyclefatigue behavior in bore areas and maxi-mized creep performance in the rim lo-cations). The lasforming of componentsfrom other base materials, such as nio-bium, rhenium, inconel, and stainlesssteel, is also planned.

Received in revised form 2 February 2018Accepted 6 February 2018Available online 7 February 2018Additive manufacturing (AM) is an advanced manufacturing technology, enabling production of complex shapes
by adding material layer-upon-layer, as distinct from conventional subtractive, forming and other manufacturing
approaches. Thus far, several metallic materials including different types of ferrous alloys have been additively
manufactured to full density with better or equivalent properties compared to counterparts made by conven-tional methods. In this perspective, this review article presents different powder-based additive manufacturingprocesses deployed to ferrous alloys, their key process parameters, phase transformation and microstructure de-

1. Introduction
AM is a rapidly growing technique, where digital 3D design data is
used to directly build up a product in a layer-by-layer process followingdeposition, melting, fusion and binding of the successive material layers
[1]. It is a direct manufacturing technology that enables to fabricate
components composed of metal, polymer, ceramic, and compositeswith intricate features through external and internal layout, and reduce
material consumption [ 2,3]. Metal AM technology has attracted indus-
try/researchers where it offers unique applications in various industriesfor replacement or customization of parts with complex geometries,Materials and Design 144 (2018) 98 –128

advantages of AM are: enabling consolidated parts for complex assem-
bly, rapid production of prototypes and reduced design iterations, and
faster market introduction of new products [ 7].
In contrast to the conventional cast and thermo-mechanical tech-
nique of material processing, in AM, there are limited options to modify
the microstructures after manufacture, mostly because products are
fabricated to near-net shape. Also, in the AM fabrication process, parts
normally show signi ﬁcant anisotropy in properties along and perpen-
dicular to the deposited layers. Samples deposited parallel (e.g. horizon-tal) or perpendicular (e.g. vertical) to the substrate undergo a different
thermal history resulting in anisotropic mechanical properties [ 8,9]. The
exact impact of process design parameters on physical and mechanicalbehaviors, and thus conformity of engineering parts fabricated via AM
is still not well understood. Therefore, determination of the mechanical
behaviors and also the in ﬂuence of process design parameters for AM
parts are of vital importance to predict their performance in service [ 10].
The goal of this paper is not to include all the existing studies related
to AM of ferrous alloys but to provide an overview for researchers to un-derstand signi ﬁcant and imminent research problems or opportunities
as well as the R&D trend in this area. To this end, the most common me-chanical properties reported in the literature for various ferrous alloys
as well as process parameters control to achieve high density, near-
net shape AM parts are investigated and reported for three AM tech-
niques; Laser Powder-Bed (LPB), Laser Powder-Fed (LPF) and Binder
Jetting (BJ) that are mainly used for the fabrication of parts composed
of ferrous alloys. Electron-beam powder-bed fusion (EPBF) has also
been used for the fabrication of parts composed of ferrous alloys; how-ever, due to a very limited number of papers in the literature, the detail
of this process is not included in the critical analysis. In addition, AM ofMetal Matrix Composites (MMCs) with ferrous alloys reinforcement el-ements, their process types and parameters, microstructural and me-
chanical properties are brie ﬂy summarized.
2. Additive manufacturing processes
2.1. Laser powder-bed (LPB)
LPB falls under powder-bed fusion AM according to ASTM commit-
tee F42 standard. LPB, also known as laser powder-bed fusion or selec-
tive laser melting (SLM), is a layer-upon-layer AM technique, where
powder is spread in a layer and melted using a focused laser beam as
shown in Fig. 1 , to produce dense metallic parts. In this process, the ob-
tainable geometric tolerance and minimum feature sizes are between40 and 200 μm[11]. The overhanging geometry is supported by
unmelted powder from previous layers. The main limitations for LPBare low build rate and the need to clear unmelted powder from internal
geometry. A review with typical process applications can be found in
[12]. LPB is widely used in multidisciplinary arenas such as, (1) in engi-
neering to manufacture light weight machine parts, complex geometri-cal components, fuel cell, architectural design etc., (2) it also has
demand in medical and dental applications because of some unique
properties. The review identi ﬁed two LPB topics generally applicable
to any alloy, namely: (i) process optimization to maximize build rateat full density, (ii) microstructure control versus mechanical properties.
The operating design of LPB is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 a. In
this technique, a numerically developed hatch stripe pattern is used
over which the laser beam is scanned to melt the deposited powder
layer as shown in Fig. 1 b[13]. The main process parameters used in
LPB are schematically shown in Fig. 1 b, where the area is divided into
stripes; comprising of several tracks detached by hatch spacing. The
track is fabricated using laser beam with a ﬁxed scan speed. During
laser scanning process, an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen is intro-duced into the chamber to minimize oxidation. The platform is heated
to about 80 °C before depositing and melting of the powder. After com-
pleting the process, the left-over powder is vacuumed and screened tob
e reused.
2.2. Laser powder-fed (LPF)
LPF falls under Directed Energy Deposition (DED) based on ASTM
committee F42 standard. It is a class of laser-based additive manufactur-ing processes to synthesize full-density and high-performance complex
metallic functional components. It is also known as laser consolidation,
laser direct metal fabrication, laser cladding with blown powder, etc.
This technique is based on a laser beam, focused on a speci ﬁca r e ao fa
part where the powder is simultaneously supplied through a nozzlepointing to the same area, layer by layer. In contrast to the LPB process,
which employs a bed of powder metal that is ‘selectively ’melted by a
laser, LPF is accomplished by simultaneously delivering metallic powderand focused laser energy, as schematically shown in Fig. 2 .
In LPF, a high power laser (e.g., Fiber, Disk, Nd:YAG or CO
2) is used to
fabricate a melt zone on a substrate within an inert atmosphere; simul-
taneously, powder is injected to the melt through the laser beam. Sub-
sequently, parts are made layer by layer using a 3D CAD ﬁle with each
layer assembled track-upon-track via a controlled tool-path.
Advantages of the LPF process include the production of near-net-
shape, full density parts with good mechanical properties and minimalimperfections (e.g. micro-cracking, distortion) [ 10,15]. A broad range
of LPF applications was observed to various areas, including: 1) netshaped solid metallic parts, 2) functionally graded materials, 3) cellular
solids, 4) in-situ alloyed parts, and 5) parts with conformal/internal fea-
tures. However, predicting the properties of fabricated parts is very
complicated due to the many process variables involved. Therefore, a
better understanding regarding the microstructural evolution andNomenclature

the properties of the deposited parts.
2.3. Binder jetting (BJ)
In the binder jetting AM process (one of the AM classes based on
ASTM standard), complex metal parts are fabricated using different ma-
terials by selectively injecting liquid binder agent into a powder bed.
The BJ process is schematically shown in Fig. 3 . After one layer is printed,
a counter-rotating roller or a wiping blade spreads a new layer of pow-der on the surface of the prior layer, which is subsequently printed and
stitched with the earlier one through jetted binder. This procedure is re-
peated to ﬁnish the green part formation. The BJ printing process is
completed by post-sintering of 3D printed green parts in a high-temperature furnace, where the polymeric binder is burned off and
the powder particles are sintered together through atomic diffusion to
achieve ﬁnal density and strength [ 16,17].
The main advantages of the BJ technique are: (1) the prevention of
residual stresses in the printed parts due to the absence of rapid heatingand cooling of the melt pool, (2) no need to support structure and build
substrate, (3) no need for environmentally controlled chamber during
the green parts fabrication, (4) compatible with highly re ﬂective mate-
rials in contrast to LPB [ 16]. However, one of the major drawbacks of the
BJ process is the dif ﬁculty to reach full density parts after the post-
sintering, leading to reduced mechanical performance of the BJ-madeparts compared to conventional manufactured ones [ 18]. Moreover, BJ
is usually unable to process ultra- ﬁne and loosely packed powders.
Ultra- ﬁne powders are dif ﬁcult to spread owing to low ﬂowability and
potential powder agglomeration due to humidity, creating defects inthe green parts. The sintered products will experience a signi ﬁcant di-
mensional change and reduction in mechanical properties [ 19].
Within the steel family, the use of metal BJ process has been limited
to the fabrication of end-use products from stainless steel (SS) powders.Binder jetted SS materials have shown applications in the area of aero-
space, energy, automotive, prosthetics [ 21,22], microwave circuits and
antennas [ 23], art, and design industry as rotors, stators, impellers, etc.
offering a signi ﬁcant manufacturing time reduction and impactful
weight and cost savings [ 24]. For example, meshed Ku band waveguides
of 420 SS are fabricated using the BJ process, which reduces the material
usage and weight by 22% while obtaining the low loss characteristic of
metallic waveguides [ 23].
2.4. Electron-beam powder-bed fusion (EPBF)
EPBF falls under the class of powder-bed fusion AM as per the ASTM
standard F3001-14 [ 25], which is a layer-by-layer process with similarcapabilities to LPB [ 26], as schematically shown in Fig. 4 . Electrostatic
charge is a consideration, leading to use of slightly larger powder(b40μm fraction excluded [ 27]). The main process differences are the
need for high vacuum and the use of the electron beam to pre-heatthe powder bed. Use of vacuum is bene ﬁcia
l in eliminating impurities
such as oxygen; however, it can also strip out low boiling point alloyingagents such as Mn [ 28]. Electron beam heating provides interesting de-
sign capabilities for microstructure control [ 29], but its capabilities ap-
pear to be largely unstudied in ferrous alloys. Work with ferrous alloysis limited to two reports, which note that the cooling rate in the build
chamber was insuf ﬁcient to harden H13 tool steel [ 28]. This is disadvan-
tageous for less hardenable low alloy materials but may lead to moreconsistent microstructure for higher alloy materials where post pro-
cessing heat treatment is necessary. Arcam AB (A GE Additive company)
is the only commercial equipment supplier for EPBF equipment and
holds the process under patent until 2022 [ 25]. This causes limited
new material development from this process [ 25,30]. However, it is rea-
sonable to expect the ﬁeld to open up as Arcam's patents expire.
3. Reﬂection on the number of relevant papers covering ferrous
alloys
Fig. 5 a, b illustrate the volume of papers associated with different
kinds of steels processed by various AM processes. Among them, major-ity of the work is reported using the LPB process (155 papers) followed
by the LPF process (54 papers), to the best knowledge of the authors and
as of August 2017.
In the literature, the BJ process (15 papers) is limited to 420 SS and
316 SS. However, compared to others, the EPBF process (2 papers) is
only available for limited work on H13 tool steel. Therefore, based on
the literature, suf ﬁcient study is not available to do a critical review of
the EPBF process.
For various AM processes of LPB, LPF and BJ, the pie charts in Fig. 6 a–
c represent the detail studies for each technique that have used steelpowders of various compositions. In the LPB process, as shown in
Fig. 6 a, almost equal amount of work has been done on H13 tool steel,
maraging steel and M2 HSS.
For other SS, i.e. 316 SS, 420 SS, 17-4 PH SS and low alloy steels, very
limited work has been reported using LPB. From Fig. 6 b, it was observed
that in LPF, the most researched steel powders were 316 L SS and H13tool steel followed by low alloy steels. However, only a limited amount
of LPF studies have been reported on using 420 SS, 304 SS and maraging
steel. In contrast to LPB, in BJ as shown in Fig. 6 c, most of the work has
been done with 316 SS and 420 SS. Also, the process covers a smallquantity of work on pure iron, 430 SS and 410 SS.

A wide range of process parameters as well as physical phenomena
control the quality of AM products. Fig. 7 summarizes these parameters
grouped as input parameters, process physics, and outputs. Commonly,
the input parameters are as follows: laser energy, motion device, pow-
der feeder set points, material, binder and ambient properties. In the de-
sign parameter chart, the output signi ﬁes the quality of the ﬁnal
product, listed as geometry, microstructure, hardness, cracks, porosity,
residual stresses, surface roughness, and dilution [ 32]. Among the detail
listed parameters in the chart ( Fig. 7 ), some of the signi ﬁcantparameters and their impact on physical and mechanical behaviors
are discussed here.
As shown in Fig. 7 , there are many common parameters for all three
processes; however, each process has its own speci ﬁcp a r a m e t e r st o o .
With this point in mind, in the following, the role of common processparameters and process speci ﬁc parameters are discussed. In addition,
the authors intend to combine several parameters together to ease thecritical review of results. To this extent a few new combined process pa-
rameters are proposed for the ﬁrst time in this review paper. It has to be
noted that some of the parameters are inherently important for a spe-
ciﬁc AM process and may not be relevant to other AM processes covered

4.1. Key process parameters and their effects on relative density
4.1.1. Hatch spacing to spot size ratio
The ratio between hatch spacing and spot size has major effects on
process stability and the regular density when LPB is used [ 33]. Asseen in literature summary represented in Fig. 8 , the majority of the
work uses hatch spacing and spot size for analysis. According to
Nakamoto et al. [ 34], highly dense part is obtained while hatch spacing
is atypically low and heating depth is high at low energy density. Also,Mertens et al. [ 35] achieved good results with large hatch spacing and
unusually high energy density, while increasing process speed withthe available laser power. When hatch spacing is reduced, re-melting
of solidi ﬁed region is a strategy to maintain density despite high scan

lap through the ratio between hatch space to spot size and its role on the
relative density. Although the plot does not represent other main pro-
cess parameters used for generating the densities, it implies that awide range of densities is achievable while the average hatch spacing
to spot size ratio is mainly set from 0.6 to 1.5.
4.1.2. Energy ratio
A consensus in the literature is that some measure of energy density
is one of the best predictors for parts relative density for both LPB and
LPF. A variety of energy density measures are used in the literature
with a volumetric density approach. Volumetric density may have the
advantages that it can be normalized against material enthalpy to be
used for the comparison of multiple materials. However, some argu-
ments have been made that the melting of multiple layers and also key-
hole shape of the melt pool invalidates the use of layer thickness for the
vertical length scale parameter [ 43]. This is backed by the observation in
the next section that the layer thickness is highly correlated with opti-mum heat pulse depth. It is expected that the melted volume does not
directly correspond to the cube de ﬁned by Volumetric Energy Density
(VED), but that melted volume will scale fairly linearly with the volumeof this cube for successful recipes [ 44,45]. However, the speci ﬁce n e r g y

This exercise has used Cpat 100 °C, which is readily available for allmaterials and neglected the latent heat of fusion that normally covers
small amount of total energy required for melting.
All plots, as shown in Fig. 9 a–d, regarding density vs. energy, show
similar trend; they reproduce well known result that energy input
should be above the minimum threshold to achieve full density part.

for full density part in steels. Based on the observed scatter, it is appar-ent that other factors are signi ﬁcant. Elevated value for enthalpy ratio
suggests that heat transfer is very signi ﬁcant for the chosen process pa-
rameters. Also, precise value for required energy density is in ﬂuenced
by powder particle size distribution [ 51,52,60]. Moreover, from the lit-
erature, it is evident that high energy density reduces dimensional con-
trol making a hard process optimization procedure to compromise
between specimen dimensionality and porosity [ 42].
4.1.3. Surface tension
In both LPB and LPF, surface tension plays an important role as it dic-
tates capillary and wetting forces and also represent if the AM process is
a diffusion based process or convention based. From [ 32], surface ten-
sion number is de ﬁned as,
S¼dγ=dTðÞ qd
μvkð3:5Þ
where ( dγ/dT) is the thermal surface tension gradient, qis the laser ﬂux,
dis the spot size, μis the dynamic viscosity of the melt, vis the scan
speed and kis the material thermal conductivity near its melting point.
For S ≤45,000, surface tension is negligible. This is one of the recom-
mended non-directional parameters which is closely related to
Marangoni number [ 38,61]. In the literature, surface tension gradient
and melt viscosity data is only readily available for pure iron, whereasviscosity estimates may be available for alloys via a generalization of
the Andrade equation [ 62–64]. A tenuous approximation of surface ten-
sion is possible via thermodynamic approaches [ 65], however as atmo-
spheric interaction is expected to be very signi ﬁcant (for both O
2&N 2)
[38,61,65,66], accurate estimations should include atmosphere data
which is not readily available. Unfortunately, signi ﬁcance of surface ten-
sion cannot be adequately/comprehensively evaluated from the litera-ture due to the factors mentioned above.

To incorporate material properties and the heat penetration
depth that would represent the keyhole depth into the analysis, the
authors propose a new combined number called “dimensionless
depth ”. The one dimensional transient model is formulated as:

time, αis thermal diffusivity, zis vertical axis, Pis laser power, kis
thermal conductivity and βis absorption factor. While, 90% of tem-
perature change occurs within 1 scaling parameter of surface [ 67],
the interaction time can be expressed by d/vwhere dis the spot
size diameter [ 61]. The heating depth can be obtained when the
limit of Eq. (3.6) approaches zero. This results in the following equa-
tion representing the heat penetration depth:

posed through a ratio of the above equation and layer thickness, leading
to a parameter so-called heating depth ratio (HDR).

The relative density versus HDR data from the literature is plotted in
Fig. 10 a. From the data available in the literature, it is apparent that, all
successful authors are operating with heating depth greater than layerthickness. Therefore, an HDR of 1.5 appears to be a good guideline for
full density parts, as shown in Fig. 10 a. Also the low part density at
high VED generally correlates with large HDR (long interaction times)as seen in Fig. 10 ba n dc . Fig. 10 c zooms into a narrower range of HDR.
From the Fig. 10 b and c, it is seen that the central trend VED require-
ment appears to increase with increasing HDR [ 37]. There are however,
a few outliers (reported density approximately above 99%) that may be
attributed to the fact that the operating in a signi ﬁcantly different mode
with respect to hatch spacing [ 26].
4.1.5. Drying time (BJ process)
In the BJ process, after printing of each powder layer, the print
bed needs some time to be dried using resistive heater, known as
‘drying time’ . To prevent blocking at the print head, it simulta-
neously shifts to a clean tank to remove extra binder materials. Ifthe drying time is not adequate, print head may be blocked, which
signiﬁcantly reduces the surface quality of the ﬁnal part [ 24]. More-
over, as demonstrated in Fig. 11 , at short drying time, binder inﬁ l-
trates only into the top thin layer leaving more pores in the green
part, which leads to a higher porosity and a higher shrinkage in the
sintering process [ 24]. Drying time should be long enough to achieve
satisfactory green strength [ 69].
As depicted in Fig. 12, a drying time ranging from 10 to 20s is ad-
equate to promote suf ﬁcient green strength and higher relative den-
sities compared to the 60s drying time. Moreover, excessive drying
time causes higher solidi ﬁcation and shrinkage rate, which eventu-
ally increases the production time and electric power consumption[24].
However, drying time is also determined by the choice of binder. For
example, diethylene glycol (DEG) binders have a longer drying time of
about 30s/layer, while phenolic binders do not require drying. There-
fore, drying time ( t
d)i sd e ﬁned as a function of powder thermal conduc-
tivity ( k), binder saturation ( S), and surface area ( A), as expressed in

4.1.6. Printing saturation (BJ process)
Printing saturation or binder saturation in BJ is the ratio of air space
between powder particles ( Vair) and binder volume ( Vbinder)[24,72]. In
simple words, saturation explains the amount of binder to be deposited
in the period of printing, and it determines the printing quality and ﬁnalsintered density, which is de ﬁned by the following equations [ 24,72].
S¼Vbinder =Vair ð3:10Þ
Vair¼1−PR
100/C18/C19
/C2Vsolid ð3:11Þ
where Vsolidis the volume of solid particles in a de ﬁned envelope. Here,
PR is the packing density of the powder bed, as de ﬁned below, [ 24].
PR¼Vpowder
Vpowder þVairð3:12Þ
Therefore, optimal binder saturation is selected based on powder
packing factor and wettability [ 70]. In order to yield suf ﬁcient green
part strength and quality, satisfactory binder saturation is needed [ 72].
If not satisfactory, some powders fall off from the part, leading to abad surface quality (zigzag surface), as shown in Fig. 13 a[24]. On the
other hand, low level saturation can result in inaccurate geometry andlow sintered density leaving porosity after binder burn-out. The exces-
sive powder bonded to the surface makes some swells on the surface
leading to bad surface roughness as depicted in Fig. 13 b.
Oversaturation also leads to unwanted wetting of the bed, thus stick-
ing powders to the roller and subsequent inhomogeneous powder bed
[70,72]. It has been shown that spherical particles use binders more ef-
ﬁciently by having small necking area between particles leading to com-
paratively low binder saturation levels [ 72]. Our review shows that
compared to the 3D printed bio-implants, which are designed to pos-sess higher porosity, lower binder saturation level gives rise to higher
relative density for ferrous alloys. The effect of printing saturation on
relative density for the 3D printed parts is shown in Fig. 14 ; however,
we do not have enough data points to be able to draw a concrete conclu-sion for ferrous alloys.
4.2. Common key process parameters for all three AM processes4.2.1. Powder characteristics
Powder properties such as ﬂowability, compressibility, tap density,
size, shape, distribution, etc. have signi ﬁcant effects on the ﬁnal AM
made parts [ 73,74]. Most research studies on the LPB processing of
maraging steels have been focused on the use of gas atomized powders
that are usually expensive. Hoeges et al. [ 75] investigated the impact of
different atomization methods on the quality of LPB processed parts.They employed high-pressure water atomization to produce maraging
steel (Ni 17 –19, Co 8.5 –9.5, Mo 4.5 –5.2, Ti 0.6 –0.8, Al 0.05 –0.15, C ≤
0.03, Cr, Cu ≤0.5, Si, Mn ≤0.1, S,P ≤0.01 wt%) with niobium instead of ti-
tanium. It is bene ﬁcial to replace titanium with niobium, because of its
lower af ﬁnity to oxygen preventing the formation of stable solid oxides
which tend to adhere to the pouring nozzle. Moreover, it optimizes the
ﬂowability of maraging steel, and minimizes oxide inclusions during the
LPB process. The detail of the formation of oxide inclusions due to theoxide contamination of the powder is focused in LPB processed 17-4

 Fig. 11. Short drying time leads to thin binder penetration [ 24].106 H. Fayazfar et al. / Materials and Design 144 (2018) 98 –128PH steel [ 76]. The researchers addressed the major drawbacks associ-
ated with water atomized powder characteristics including irregular
particle shape, lower tap densities, and oxidized surfaces. More impor-
tantly, there is a slight difference in the avalanche angle between
water atomized and gas atomized maraging steel powder (1°). The
smaller the avalanche angle, the better the processability of the powder;
therefore, the powder will spread more smoothly during the deposition
of a thin powder layer [ 75]. It should be noted that water atomized pure
iron powder (WA-Fe-Powder) with avalanche angle of ~54° has shownsufﬁcient ﬂowability to be processed with additive manufacturing ma-
chines, and is documented as a minimum requirement for the process-ability in LPB. In addition, Latenneur et al. [ 73], worked on WA-Fe based
powder using the LPB process, where process parameters were opti-mized to improve density and mechanical properties of the 3D printed
parts. While gas atomized maraging steel has been most widely used
for additive manufacturing [ 75,77], there are not many papers associ-
ated with water atomized powders. Nevertheless, the mechanical prop-erties of the water as well as gas-atomized powders for a few steel alloys
are compared in Table 1 [75].In the BJ process, powder characteristics such as particle size, mor-
phology, density, tap density, and ﬂowability affect the ﬁnal properties
of the AM components. For example, spherical particles are mostly pre-ferred, although irregular particles are able to improve green strength
without achieving uniform density. Furthermore, in order to reach
good packing of powder layers and high green density, tap density of
the powder should be satisfactory. Insuf ﬁcient tap density leads to
high porosity levels in the green components and subsequent high
shrinkage during sintering, which makes it dif ﬁcult to reach desired
density and tolerances of the ﬁnal component [ 78].
The powder particle size distribution (PSD) has a signi ﬁcant in ﬂu-
ence on the entire BJ process from making green parts to post process-ing. Dourandish et al. [ 69] showed that sintering behavior of complex-
shaped biomedical parts of 316 L SS signi ﬁcantly depends on the PSD.
Solid state sintering governs the densi ﬁcation of 316 L SS powders.
However, using ﬁne 316 L powder, after sintering the total amount of
porosity is low (~12%) with relatively small pores. When coarse 316 L
particles are used, a higher total porosity (~20%) with a signi ﬁcant
amount of large (~100 –300μm) pores is observed. Moreover, the
amount of carbon pick-up during de-bonding and sintering depends
on the powder particle size. The amount of carbon pick-up for ﬁne pow-
der is 0.2 wt% compared to 0.07 wt% for coarse powders, which is attrib-uted to the lower layer thickness and lower amount of binder used for
3D printing [ 69].
4.2.2. Layer thickness/layer slicing strategy
In steel alloys fabricated by LPB, higher layer thickness causes a de-
crease in relative density as extracted from published sources andshown in Fig. 15 . Consequently, layer thickness in ﬂuen
ces the macro-
hardness together with the scan speed [ 77,79,80]. To make the plot
more representative, different color is used to focus different laser
power, scanning speed, etc.; however, the plot is normalized around
layer thickness.
Some studies have been carried out to control the three-dimensional
deposition by the LPF technique [ 32,89–91]. It is known that if the pro-
cess parameters are not completely optimized, the ﬁnal layer thickness
might be dissimilar to the original setting value, even with the use of
height control device. To ﬁnd out the impact of process design parame-
ters on the layer thickness of H13 tool steel, actual layer thickness was
measured. The dissimilarity in the ﬁnal layer thickness from the setting
values in terms of thickness error distribution is shown in Fig. 16 a. It is
seen that to achieve a good dimensional accuracy in H13 tool steel,
layer thickness might be ﬁxed as 0.254 or 0.381 mm. Also according to
results shown in Fig. 16 b, superior dimensional accuracy can be ob-
tained by high powder mass feed rate. Therefore, in this process, both
layer thickness and porosity greatly depend on powder mass feed rate
and overlap percentages with a constant laser input power.020406080100

possibility of actual layer thickness formation is enhanced [ 90]. How-
ever, in case of de ﬁciency of energy input, the overlap of the melted
track should be N50% [ 90]. By contrast, in another research, it is claimed
that 40% overlap in H13 tool steel gives the best combination of layer
thickness and maximum volume of deposition rate [ 91]. It has been re-
ported that the layer thickness in LPF fabricated products shows a keyrole in the ﬁnal parts microstructure. In particular, for H13, by increasing
the layer thickness or speci ﬁc energy, the primary dendrite widths are
enhanced. In addition, the ﬁner grain and the higher cooling rates can
be obtained by a lower speci ﬁc energy, lower layer thickness but by a
higher speed [ 91]. For H13 tool steel, it is then shown a progressive re-
lationship among the outputs of layer thickness and speci ﬁce n e r g y
with powder mass feed rate [ 91].
An interesting strategy to achieve dimensional accuracy is by layer
slicing. In the LPF process, the CAD design part is sliced into parallel
layers and synthesized in a layer-wise method. This method is only ap-
plicable to surfaces where normal vectors are not aligned to 0° or 90°
with the process direction. Therefore, in spite of a feasible solution of
this method, the staircase effect (a surface with step-like features) still
remains [ 92]. There are some studies re ﬂecting on the slicing procedure
to reduce staircase effects, such as the volumetric difference betweenlayers [ 93] and controlling layer thickness [ 94]. However, these
methods are considered for ﬁxed direction deposition processes and
do not entirely remove the staircase effect. There are other methodolo-
gies such as, multi-axis processing to minimize the staircase effect. In
this method the slicing direction rotates to 90°, in case of an overhang
structure instead of taking the classical parallel slicing procedure
[95,96].
It has been reported that layer thickness in BJ is the most critical fac-
tor that affects the integrity of the part. It also determines the possibility
to design of smallest feature size [ 24]. High layer thickness results in un-
bounded layers, while applying a thin layer leads to pushing away of the
printed layers during spreading of the next powder layer [ 69]. Gener-
ally, it is believed that better end-product properties are achievedwhen applying a low layer thickness, while building time will consider-
ably increase as a tradeoff [ 24]. It is also reported that layer thickness
must be bigger than the diameter of the largest particle [ 70] or at least
one diameter of the largest particle in the powder feedstock [ 15]. In
this review, layer thickness/average particle size is de ﬁned as one ofthe key parameters that need to be identi ﬁed and controlled; however,
the capability of the BJ machine constrains the choice of the layer thick-
ness. Our review shows that higher relative densities are attained when
the ratio of layer thickness to average particle size is in the range of 2.3
to 3.3, as shown in Fig. 17 . It should be noted that to reach a ﬁrm conclu-
sion more data points are necessary.

 process parameter for BJ
4.3.1. Binder burnout and sintering
The binder used in BJ AM technique is typically a glycerol based
binder, which mainly occupies the interstitial spaces among the powder
particles to hold the powder together in the desired shape. In the post-
processing step, green part is subjected to binder burnout followed by
sintering process, normally in a single step. Particle size distribution
and alloy chemistry have a direct impact on sintering kinetics. In
solid-state sintering, particle diameter is the main governing factor
[70]. Conversely, in super solidus liquid-phase sintering regime, both
particle diameter and liquid volume fraction control the sintering kinet-ics. Liquid volume fraction is the overriding factor. The alloy chemistry is
as i g n i ﬁcant factor in selecting the optimized process temperature [ 70].
It is important to determine a correct sintering set temperature to ob-tain full density and suf ﬁcient mechanical properties. Frykholm et al.
[78] suggest that 316 L SS green parts are required to be sintered at a
temperature close to solidus temperature (1360 –1380 °C) and inTable 1

Cr loss from the surface, and preserves the corrosion resistance of the
steel. In addition, sintering at high temperature leads to the formation
of delta-ferrite, which is favorable for mechanical performance and cor-
rosion resistance. After cooling, some residues of ferrite remain in the
material; however, the impact of the low amount of delta-ferrite (up
to 8%) is somewhat negligible. To yield higher densities, the sinteringtemperature could be increased, but this is not generally recommended
as the higher temperature might affect tolerances. In this review,
sintering temperature/melting temperature (T/T

parameter for post-processing of components processed through binderjetting 3D printing. From the review work as plotted in Fig. 18 ;i ti s
stated that higher relative densities are achieved when the T/T
mis in
the range of 0.8 –1, with the highest relative density of 99.8 attained at
T/Tm= 0.89. Vacuum sintering is another option to improve the ﬁnal
density by eliminating trapped air inside the samples [ 98].
4.3.2. Sintering additives
In BJ, it is known that incorporation of sintering additives into the
base material enhances the densi ﬁcation and ﬁnal structural integrity
[97]. Sun et al. [ 99] demonstrated the effectiveness of adding silicon ni-
tride (Si3N4) on density, dimensional accuracy, and mechanical proper-ties for 3D printing processed 420 SS in a series of sintering conditions.
From their work, it is evident that the 3D printed parts with additives
can achieve a high relative density (~98%) and excellent mechanical
properties (~200 GPa) with a slight distortion after sintering at 1300
°C. However, because of the large amount of silicon nitride (12.5 wt%
~28 vol%), the part is not considered to be a 420 SS anymore.
Among the various sintering additives, boron (B), carbon (C), and ni-
trogen (N) are the most effective elements to reduce the liquidus tem-
perature, as shown in Fig. 19 [98]. For example, addition of 4 wt% B in
iron (Fe) can reduce the eutectic point to 1174 °C in Fe-B phase diagram[98]. The sintering process is enhanced by the transformation of a solid
to a liquid phase. With the adequate volume of liquid phase in the greenpart, sintering temperature is reduced and the sample density is im-
proved whereas the excessive formation of liquid phase substantially
destroys the sample shape. In powder mixture of SS and B, the liquid
phase starts to occur from the location of high concentration of B and
dissolves the neighboring SS powders as the liquidus temperature
lowers the sintering temperature. However, the higher concentration
of sintering additives causes the formation of extensive liquid phase to
lose the intended sample shape and can lead to the formation of pores
[97].
4.3.3. In ﬁltration of nanoparticles into porous BJ printed parts
Another strategy to improve the density of BJ parts involves the in-
corporation of nanoparticles into the inkjet ﬂuid to ﬁll the void spacesbetween the powder particles. However, nanoparticles may have im-
pact on viscosity of the binder being jetted to make inkjet deposition
challenging or impossible [ 18]. Following this approach where nanopar-
ticles behave as a sintering additive, objects with densities up to 86.8%are achieved as void ﬁlled nanoparticles increases the packing factor
of the powder bed [ 101]. Addition of metal nanoparticles will improve
mechanical properties and dimensional accuracy, decrease the sinteringtemperatures, and offer multi-functional aspects to 3D printed parts; for
example, thermal and electrical conductivity [ 101].
The chosen nanoparticles should be compatible with the composi-
tion of ﬁnal parts, thus not negatively impacting the ﬁnal material prop-
erties. Increasing the packing factor of the powder bed by incorporatingnanoparticles was ﬁrst adopted by Crane et al. [ 102], where iron nano-
particles dispersed in an organic solvent were employed to improvethe quality of 3D printed 410 SS. Iron nanoparticles are excellent candi-
date for steel parts since addition of several percent more iron nanopar-
ticles impacts slightly on the part composition.
During heating, the nanoparticle deposits, and sintering of nanopar-
ticle toughens the bonds between particles, followed by shrinkage of
deposits, which is schematically shown in Fig. 20 . The differences in
shrinkage kinetics between the associated powder and the productscan cause cracks, which can be repaired by reapplying the nanoparticles,
then the newly formed cracks are smaller than the previous ones.
In another attempt, Elliott et al. [ 101]i nﬁltrated 316 L stainless steel
3D parts by 316 nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were suspended in
wa
ter mixed with two liquid polymer carriers, diethylene glycol
(DEG) or ethylene glycol (EG), and deposited drop-wise to a sintered3D printed binder jetted part. This process depends on pH and molar
ratio of water and polymers. The higher polarity of DEG compared to
EG at a pH level of 11 and a DEG/H
2O molar ratio of 1:4 leads to the en-
hancement of dispersion and in ﬁltration of nanoparticles in the 3D parts
and subsequent increase in mass and density followed by sintering.
Bailey et al. [ 18] produced a nanoparticle, binder, and powder sys-
tem that is more comparable to the BJ process by suspending copper
nanoparticles in binder and adding the mixture to the 430 SS powder.
Nano copper was selected only because it provides contrast with pow-
der particles, which helps to distinguish the location of the nanoparti-
cles inside the part. The quantity of nanoparticle parent solution is
determined based on the parent solution's packing factor and targeted
fraction of void space between skeleton particles [ 18].
However, incorporation of nanoparticles introduces dimensional in-
stability, because of shrinkage and creep; especially at high in ﬁltration
temperature of steel [ 102]. To minimize creep de ﬂections during in ﬁl-
tration, parts were packed with refractory powder; which is also chal-lenging for complex shaped parts. Also, the shrinkage difference
between the packing powder and parts may cause tearing during
sintering. Moreover, at higher nanoparticle contents, a substantial
foaming or void expansion occurs during curing. This is because the

vent the solvent in the binder from escaping, thus creating large cavi-
ties/visible porosities in the parts. On the other hand, the presence of
nanoparticles becomes more evident between the larger SS particles
leading to an increase in the sintering of SS due to the nano-copper be-
having as a sintering aid [ 18].
4.3.4. Liquid metal in ﬁltration
Another route of densi ﬁcation is by the in ﬁltration of liquid-metal,
with negligible dimensional changes. Therefore, in BJ technique, metalparts are usually in ﬁltrated with a low melting point material such as
bronze in order to remove residual porosity and obtain full density[97,103]. This manufacturing process counts on capillarity of the
inﬁltrant material to be absorbed by pores on the surface [ 103]. Inﬁltra-
tion changes the nature of the material while ﬁlling the pores of the
printed material which slightly enhances the mechanical properties in-cluding hardness, elastic modulus, yield strength, etc. [ 17,97].
Sachs et al. [ 103] made an attempt to fabricate injection molding
tooling of 316 SS, where cooling channels were conformal with themolding cavity. They introduced a new technique called “stilt in ﬁltra-
tion ”which assures that the channels would be free of in ﬁltrant with al-
most no under-in ﬁltration or over-in ﬁltration of the part and clogged
passages. Also in the process, the sample was raised on the top of theinﬁltrant surface, which created a negative pressure in the in ﬁltrant
causing the in ﬁltrant to be kept out of the cooling channels. From this
approach, it is assured that passages will not be ﬁlled above somecritical range. During in ﬁltration, channels should be placed horizon-
tally, in a way to maintain the capillary rise between parallel walls. Ifthe in ﬁltrant angle with respect to the walls is close to zero, then the
capillary rise is given by the following [103 ],
h¼

ρgωð3:15Þ
where ωis the spacing between the walls, for the molten in ﬁltrant, his
the capillary rise, γis the surface tension, ρis the density, and ցis the ac-
celeration of gravity.
Cordero et al. [ 104], also fabricated a dense ferrous alloy by in ﬁltra-
tion of molten bronze, which showed higher rupture strength by elim-inating stress concentration between the particle necks.
The optimum saturation of in ﬁltrant liquid is signi ﬁcantly important
to manufacture a standard green product. If the liquid in ﬁltrant exceeds
the saturation level, dimensional accuracy will be destroyed by the mi-gration of excess in ﬁltrant. On the other hand, lack of in ﬁltrant can cause
weak bonding between particles. Therefore, precise estimation ofinﬁltrant saturation is vital for the design of BJ printed parts.

The high carbon steel contains a continuous phase like martensite,
whereas in SS, continuous phase is often retained austenite, which pre-
vents cracking. Cracking is worst in M2 and H13 steel that can beblocked by preheating to partially or fully suppress martensite forma-
tion. In LPB, rapid solidi ﬁcation is insuf ﬁcient to suppress segregation
but generally results in ﬁne microstructure. Also, low melting phase is
sufﬁciently discontinuous to avoid segregation cracking. This type of
phenomena is observed in high copper alloy 17-4 PH SS [ 106]. The
crack formation is also reported in the LPB processed high silicon steel
(6.9 wt%), which was in ﬂuenced by higher laser energy input [ 45].11001300150017001900

niques result in a deposited layer with higher residual stresses and con-
sequently cracking [ 107]. LPB introduces tensile residual stresses
because of the localized input of high laser energy in a very short periodof time, and together with the lower thermal conductivity of the pow-
der, a higher temperature gradient is developed near the laser spot
[45]. Consequently, the expansion of the heat affected zone is repressed
by the neighboring material, which usually causes plastic compression.
Again, during the cooling, the contraction af ﬁnity of the upper layers is
neutralized by the subsequent layers, which cause tensile stresses thatare major source of cracking.
In comparison between austenitic SS and low-carbon steels, the for-
mer is more sensitive to solidi ﬁcation cracking than the later one be-
cause of their lower thermal conduction and higher thermalexpansion coef ﬁcients. Moreover, some contaminants like sulfur and
phosphorous have a profound impact on cracking in SS. Table 2 shows
the cracking behavior of different water/gas atomized 316 SS powders
linked with impurity amount. The cracking sensitivity becomes less by
decreasing S + P + Si content. It is also claimed that, a considerable ni-
trogen value is harmful to solidi ﬁcation cracking [ 108].
5.2. Porosity
Generally, in AM, it is believed that the tendency of pore formation
can be diminished (or controlled) by optimizing the process parame-
ters, i.e. laser scan speed or laser power [ 109,110]. There are various rea-
sons behind the formation of interlayer porosity including;(i) mismatch between mechanical properties of the underlying layer,
(ii) mismatch between thermal elongation due to sharp temperature
distribution in the deposited material, (iii) enclosed gas entrapped in
the melt, (iv) chemical reaction between different feedstock etc.
[111 –113]. It was observed that low ductile materials show a greater
tendency to interlayer porosity [ 112]. A recent study suggests that spec-
iﬁed critical level of porosity and gas content in the starting powder has
a profound impact on the interlayer porosity formation. Choi et al. [ 90]
statistically investigated the pore formation in AISIH13 tool steel andconcluded that the powder feed rate is a considerable factor, in ﬂuencing
porosity [ 114].
Primarily two types of porosity are considered: (1) gas porosity; re-
sulted from encapsulated gas due to incomplete melting of particleswith internal-porosity, and (2) lack of fusion (LOF) porosity due to
voids that create among unmelted or incompletely melted powder par-
ticles. The former can be resolved by using powders free of gas porosity,
while the later can be prevented by complete melting of the powder
[115]. It is worth considering that LOF is the most detrimental ﬂaw as
it may act as a crack initiator as well as lead to a complete failure. Carefulselection of process parameters should be considered in order to dimin-
ish crack formation and propagation [ 111,116].
Table 3 represents the impact of both laser power and powder feed-
ing rate of H13 tool steel on pore formation in the LPF process. The re-
sults indicate that only powder feed rate is a crucial factor for the
porosity formation in H13 tool steel. Also, as seen, in case of higher pow-
der feed rate, porosity level can be reduced with increasing the laser
power input. It should be noticed that achieving a desirable quality
can be challenging. For example, obtaining actual layer thickness is
more probable at a higher powder mass ﬂow rate, but on the other
hand, chance of pore formation is increased [ 90]. By optimizing the
l
ayer thickness of single clad tracks with adequate energy input, the po-
rosity may be eliminated. In addition, choosing a suitable overlap be-tween tracks can be another effective solution to reduce porosity.
A research work on H13 tool steel demonstrated that with a lower
energy input, the overlap should be N50% [ 90]. In another work on
H13, it is pointed out that acceptable layer thickness is b0.7 mm, and
the ratio of energy/mass must be higher than 40 KJ/g to avoid pore for-
mation [ 91]. In addition, the higher nominal speci ﬁce n e r g yc a nr e s u l ti n
the lower pore/void formation. Also, Fig. 21 represents the speci ﬁcenergy vs. porosity obtained from the literature on H13 tool steel with
relevant normalized powder feed rate [ 117]. The normalized powder

Table 4 shows the summary of the effect of various parameters on
porosity level in different steels. The behavior of porosity in both 420
and 4140 low alloy steel has been investigated in several experiments.
For 420 SS, the linear mass density (m

to identify a proper combination of powder feed rate and laser traversevelocity to result in a fully dense part.
Fig. 22 a shows that there is an optimal linear mass density, (

lower value, no porosity is observed, and at a higher value, the porosityincreases linearly with increasing linear mass density. For the 420 SS de-
posited on a 420 SS substrate, the critical linear mass density is 0.0115 g/mm to arrive at a full density part [ 115]. This optimal amount for 4140
SS on a 1045 steel substrate is approximately 0.018 g/mm, as showninFig. 22 b. It can be seen that there are many combinations of powder
ﬂow rates and laser speeds to obtain a fully dense specimen. Values
out of the optimal mass density range lead to lack of fusion porosity
[115].
6. Microstructure development
6.1. General microstructural characteristics in AM ferrous alloys
In both LPB and LPF processes, the manufactured parts are usually
pass through the complex thermal cycles; (i) rapid heating due to the
absorption of laser energy, (ii) fast solidi ﬁcation of the melted region
in the absence of heat source, (iii) substantial temperature gradients,(iv) accumulated heat and (v) reheating/recooling due to the laser en-
ergy in the adjacent layers/tracks. The frequent re-melting and re-
solidifying progressions are continued when the subsequent layers are
exposed to heat [ 10,120,121]. While non-equilibrium thermodynamics
govern the physics of the microstructure formation in LPF and LPB, ther-mal cycle depends upon many process variables, hence predicting the
microstructural characteristics of AM components, and the impact of
process parameters on them, is still poorly understood.Table 2

above de ﬁned thermal history, where three main grain morphologies
are observed in steel processed by AM: (i) columnar, (ii) mixture of co-
lumnar and equiaxed, and (iii) equiaxed. In other words, the AM proc-
essed steel typically show three different regions; (i) interface region,
(ii) columnar grain region and (iii) equiaxed grain region. The predilec-
tion of microstructure is governed by a crucial control parameter pro-
posed by Hunt [ 122], based on related solidi ﬁcation theory; the ratio
of temperature gradient Gand the solidi ﬁcation velocity V S, i.e. G/V S.
In an extremely large G/VS,w h e nV Stends to zero, the solidi ﬁcation mi-
crostructure contains planar grains. In a relatively high value, the pre-dominant solidi ﬁcation microstructure would be columnar dendrites
and smaller G/V
Svalue gives rise to equiaxed grains. In LPB, the heat is
mostly transmitted through the formerly deposited layers, and develops
the highest temperature gradient in that direction, which eventually in-
ﬂuences the formation of directional columnar dendrites.
However, this may not be the case for LPF as the melt pool transverse
angle with respect to the substrate ( θs) can vary from 30 to 70° that can
change the solidi ﬁcation rate by a factor of cos( θs)[32]. If the tempera-
ture gradient becomes alike in some directions, grains tend to grow in
that directions and become equiaxed. A schematic of solidi ﬁed melt
pool with different zones is shown in Fig. 23 a. The melt pool consists
of equiaxed grains in Zone I and columnar grains in Zone II, alsoshown in Fig. 23 b. The shape and growth of dendrites are different at
different layers based on the heat dissipation, as depicted in Fig. 23 b.
During the LPF process, bottom layer is heated for a long time which
may cause tempering effect and the accumulated heat can result in den-dritic growth. On the other hand, at the top layer because of rapid
cooling rate dendrites solidify very quickly and have no time to grow
coarsely. Also in the LPB process, the microstructure developed is com-
plex because of continuous re-melting process and the Marangoni effect
that causes different heat ﬂow directions in the same melt pool. This
phenomenon eventually creates different grain growth orientations[123]. The higher thermal gradient, i.e. 10
6K/m in the LPB process
causes columnar microstructure in most of the materials [ 124]. More-
over, in LPB, the temperature gradients are interrupted by thermalconductivity of powder as well as solidi ﬁed zone [ 125]. As the heat dis-
sipation through the build direction is higher compared to the other di-rections, solidi ﬁcation in that direction results in anisotropy in grain
morphology and mechanical properties. Also in LPB and LPF, coolingrates tend to be high because the area that laser beam heats up is rela-
tively small. Therefore, small heat affected zones and ﬁner microstruc-
tures can be obtained in comparison with conventionally cast samples
[122,126]. Yadroitsev et al. [ 127] explored that the 316 L SS processed
with LPB presented higher yield strength compared to the forged mate-rials. This statement is supported by Song et al. [ 37], where he stated
that, the better mechanical property of LPB processed samples wasdue to the presence of smaller grains and higher dislocation density, as-
sociated with rapid solidi ﬁcation.
6.2. Solidi ﬁcation and phase transformation in AM steels
The phase transformation and microstructure development in AM
processed steels are completely different compared to the conventional
cast steels, which pass through slower cooling rates as well as gradual/
equilibrium thermo-mechanical processes after casting to obtain more
homogeneous material properties. Austenitic SS, (e.g. 316 L and 304)
usually shows a completely austenitic microstructure in AM processed
steel. Sun et al. [ 128] employed a detail microstructural characterization
in LPB processed austenitic SS 316 L, where two main phases were iden-tiﬁed as primary austenite (fcc γ) and small amount of retained ferrite
(bcc δ) without any formation of martensite. However, Tucho et al.
[129] identi ﬁed traces of martensite and/or ferrite phases in austenite
matrix in LPB processed 316 SS. Zhang [ 126] observed complete austen-
ite phases in LPF of SS 316 L, but some ferrite phase was also observed
by Yadollahi et al. [ 130]. Also, in LPB processed austenitic SS 304, similar
elongated grains in building direction and complete austenite phasewith no carbide precipitates were observed [ 131]. Similar austenitic
phase with columnar structure is reported by Yu et al. [ 132], in LPB proc-
essed 304 SS. In this work, the mechanical anisotropy was compared be-
tween LPB processed 304 SS and Ti-6Al-4 V alloy, which is related tomicrostructure morphology governed by directional solidi ﬁcation. Dur-
ing the fast cooling stage involved in LPB processed SS 316 L, the high-temperature ferrite phase was not transformed to a low-temperature
austenite phase. This retained ferrite phase eventually strengthens the
austenitic matrix. For similar composition of Cr and Ni in SS up to Cr/
Ni ratio of about 1.5, the solidi ﬁcation microstructure mainly contains
austenite phases [ 133].
The microstructure of the conventional martensitic SS fabricated in
the AM process is found to form some austenite phases together withmartensite, which is stated for 17-4 PH SS, maraging steel (18Ni300),
and also for the martensitic SS grade AISI420. 17-4 PH steel fabricated
through the LPB process contains a signi ﬁcant amount of retained aus-
tenite with body centered cubic (bcc)/martensite and ﬁne niobium car-
bides (NbC) favorably arranged through dendritic boundaries [ 106].
Ac
cording to Cheruvathur et al. [ 106] during solidi ﬁcation of AM 17-4
steel, from the liquid the ﬁrst phase is formed as: bcc/ferrite followed
by bcc + fcc/austenite. Also, some MC phases enriched with Nb isformed. When solidi ﬁcation is roughly completed, the fcc turns as the
major phases, and at the end of solidi ﬁcation, approximately equivalent
amounts of bcc and fcc phases and small amount of NbC are detected.

crostructure consisting of austenite and martensite phases, with both
twinned and un-twinned regions adjacent to the martensitic grains.
The retained austenite is observed among the martensite plates. Kudzal
et al. [ 135] and LeBrun et al. [ 136] examined the same phenomenologi-
cal phase structure in 17-4 PH SS. During the cooling stages in LPB, the
residual thermal stresses in the material cannot transfer all austenite
to martensite, which result in retained austenite [ 136]. Mainly retained
austenite forms at grain boundaries, because of the irregular atomic ar-rangement, which stops further growth of martensite [ 137]. Therefore,
ﬁner grain sizes enclosing more grain boundaries may in ﬂuence the oc-
currence of more retained austenite in LPB of 17-4 PH SS. Al-Mangour
et al. [ 138 –140] worked on the LPF processed 17-4 SS, and reported
on the microstructural phase transformation during shot-peening (SP)and heat-treatment. From their experiment, the retained austenite ofas-built sample passed through the SP process and possessed martens-
ite phase transformation [ 139]. Their another study also explored mi-
crostructure development at different aging temperatures, wherefractions of retained austenite was observed at 866 K but showed fully
martensite at lower temperature of 755 K [ 138].
For both LPB and LPF processes, maraging steel grade 18Ni-300
shows similar tendency to form cellular/dendritic structure and epitax-ial growth of the solidi ﬁed grains [ 77,141]. This martensitic SS has a con-
siderable amount of retained austenite and upon aging precipitation,together with austenite reversion is occurred [ 77,141,142]. The austen-
ite reversion is expected during long period of aging, because the meta-stable martensite converts to stable austenite. During the aging process,
Ni is released into the Fe matrix and convoys the conversion from Ni3
(Mo, Ti) to further steady Fe
2Mo precipitates, which stimulates austen-
ite reversion [ 143]. Campanelli et al. [ 144] investigated the microstruc-
tural morphology in 18Ni (300) maraging steel clad produced on AISI
304 substrate in the LPF process. The presence of equiaxed and elon-
gated grains also with dendrite morphology were alike to that observed
by Casalino et al. [ 88] in the LPB process of maraging steel. Their work
revealed a microstructure with ﬁne martensite phases and a transfor-
mation of austenite to Fe-Ni martensite. Austenite reversion is also ex-
plored by Krakhmalev et al. [ 145] in LPB processed AISI 420
martensitic SS. The top layer revealed martensite and retained austenitein contrast to inner layer where tempered martensite was present with
higher volume of austenite. The LPB process is a multi-step technique
containing repeated thermal cycles (melting-solidifying), which then
believed to cause stabilization of austenite by rearrangement of carbon
between martensite and austenite. Their selective diffusion result in the
austenite reversion and consequent growth of retained austenite. In an-
other investigation of martensitic SS SC420 processed in LPF [ 146],
showed tempered martensite with ﬁne carbides and ferrite along the
grain boundary.
Mertens et al. [ 35] worked on LPB processed H13 tool steel, and re-
ported a signi ﬁcant observation in microstructure development with
different powder bed pre-heating temperatures. The microstructureafter preheating at 200 °C, is comparable to the microstructure obtained
without preheating which constitutes a martensitic phase as well as
retained austenite. After preheating at 400 °C, which is above the mar-
tensite transformation temperature will produce bainite; an intermedi-
ate form between martensite and pearlite. Yan et al. [ 132] also reported
martensitic phases decomposed into α-Fe and Fe
3C with retained aus-
tenite in the LPB processed H13 tool steel. During LPF of H13 toolsteel, the microstructure morphology is columnar to equiaxed grains
and most of the grains contain martensite phases [ 90,91].
During LPB of a high strength low alloy steel, e.g. HY100 [ 39], the mi-
crostructure in the molten region after solidi ﬁcation is fully austenitic;
that completely converts to martensite (untempered) by rapid solidi ﬁ-
cation. It is already reported in many work [ 147,148] that HY100 steel

to diffuse out of supersaturated martensite, and reacts with Fe, Cr, and
Mo to form carbides in the matrix of martensite.

7. AM modeling for ferrous alloys
Modeling of AM processes is extremely important for the process pa-
rameters optimization and to provide prediction of residual stresses andmicrostructure evolution in 3D printed parts. Three categories of
models can be found in literature: numerical, analytical and empirical.
In LPB and LPF processes, melt pool formation [ 150], laser particle inter-
action process [ 151], temperature, velocity and thermal stress ﬁeld dis-
tributions over the process, can be simulated by numerical models
[152 –154]. Analytical models take into consideration the physics of
the processes and the process optimization. In the literature, analyticalmodels have been employed to predict the melt pool depth, dilution
and the temperature ﬁeld with known values of clad height and width
[155]. In their work Fathi et al., used a parabolic equation to build the
melt pool's top surface and the temperature ﬁeld was predicted solving
the heat conduction in substrate based on an in ﬁnite moving point heat
source [ 155]. Tan et al. [ 156], estimated the clad layer geometry based
on a moving disc heat source model. An ellipse was used to ﬁtt h e
melt pool and the powder catchment ef ﬁciency was calculated as the
ratio of melt pool and the powder stream area. Most of these modelshave different prediction accuracy, since they have either decoupled
the heat and mass ﬂow interactions in the LPF process or did not take
into consideration the changes of the laser power absorptivity [ 157].
Huang et al. have developed an analytical model for LPF that combines
the main physical changes of the whole process with the attenuated
laser power, the heated powder stream and the semi-in ﬁnite substrate
taking in consideration their intensity spatial distribution and concen-tration [ 157]. The original laser beam intensity distribution on substrate
is shown in Fig. 24 a, with maximum value of 660 J/mm
2,w h i l et h ea t -
tenuated laser intensity loss of around 28 J/mm2, by the powder is
shown in Fig. 24 b[157].
The temperature ﬁeld on substrate surface, shown in Fig. 24 c, was
obtained coupling the attenuated laser beam and the heated powder
stream that is considered the moving heat source. Two half ellipses
were used to approximate the melt pool projection geometry on the
substrate surface, and are displayed as dashed lines in Fig. 24 c.
The modeling and simulation of LPB-AM are mostly based on nu-
merical models, which incorporate multi-physics by means of Lattice
Boltzmann method [ 158] or the Lagrangian-Eulerian method [ 159]
and cover either the hydrodynamic or the thermodynamic aspects.Empirical modeling are more time-ef ﬁcient [ 160] compared to the nu-
merical models, but are case sensitive, while numerical models requires
high computation to capture the complex phenomena in the molten
pool [ 157]. Numerical modeling of the LPB process consists of simula-
tions at the micro level (melt-pool modeling) and at the macro level(part-level simulation). At the melt-pool modeling level, multiple phys-
ics phenomena should be considered: heat conduction, heat convection
and radiation, capillary effects, Marangoni effect, photon absorption by
particles [ 161]. Panwisawas and coworkers [ 161], taking into consider-
ation most of the interfacial phenomena in their model, they derived thetemperature distribution of single-track molten zones. It was demon-
strated that the irregularity of the single tracks increased as the laser-
scan speed increased. Regarding part level simulations, analytical and
numerical modeling has been used to study the residual stresses in
the LPB processes [ 162] and to investigate the temperature and stress
distributions in one single layer in LPB [ 163]. Analytical models, do not
incorporate the multi-physics, and are less common due to the more
complex physics behind the LPB AM process. For instance, the model
proposed by Knol [ 164] describes the process parameters effect on the
residual stresses and the porosity through a semi-analytical thermalmodel. In their model, the authors build the powder bed temperature
ﬁeld adding the analytical temperature solution together with the nu-
merical boundary correction solution.
Although there are many modeling papers for LPF and LPB, the num-
ber of modeling papers in which the target materials are ferrous alloys is
limited. A summary of the input parameters and outputs employed for
the modeling of different AM process, where ferrous alloys used for
model veri ﬁcation and process parameters prediction, is presented in

8.1. Hardness8.1.1. Hardness for LPF processed parts
In the literature, clearly distinguished microstructure zones with
micro-hardness have been reported for LPF processed AISI P20 tool
steel [ 170], AISIH13 tool steel [ 91,171,172], AISI 420 tool steel [ 173],
AISI 4140 steel [ 174], AISI 410 SS [ 109] and AISI 316 L SS [ 118]. It has
been stated that for steels, the micro-hardness values of multilayers de-
creases from the ﬁrst deposited layer and then increases towards the
top layers [ 118,174,175] due to the heating up of the previous layers
and giving them time to be slightly annealed [ 91]. Furthermore, this in-
homogeneity can be ascribed to the time-changing solidi ﬁcation rate in
the melt zone and a relatively slower rate in the central area. As a result,
higher micro-hardness has generally been recognized at the top and
bottom of LPF parts in comparison with the middle region [ 10].
InFig. 25 for different kind of steels, the data for speci ﬁc energy vs.
the average micro-hardness is presented, as obtained from the litera-
tures. From the Fig. 25 , shown that, H13 tool steel has the highest hard-
ness among the other steels included in these studies, as expected.
Between the low alloy steels; ASTM/SAE 4140, 4130, and 1045 are
anticipated to be the hardest steel because of the higher content of
alloying elements, as well as higher carbon content in 4140 and 4130
[180]. In another research work on 4140 steel, hardness was measured
at different regions of the clad. The hardness value near the substratesurface was an average of 375 HK500, in the middle of the sample was330 HK500 and the very last layer showed the hardness of 386HK500. These hardness values were comparable to other works avail-
able in the literature, which associated with the formation of bainite
and tempered martensitic [ 181,182]. In other publication, the hardness
values of the deposited 18Ni (300) maraging steel was found between347 and 350 HV [ 176 –179]. These values are in agreement with the
usual microhardness of 18Ni (300) steel after solution annealing heat
treatment, as referred in the ASM Handbook [ 144,183].
In H13 tool steel, the internal part hardness somewhat diminished
towards the center and bottom of the sample because of re-heating dur-
ing the process [ 91]. Similar behavior was observed for 316 SS, where
the Vickers microhardness values of clad surface intensi ﬁed compared
to the inside of the clad, as the clad surface experiences the cooling ef-
fect of shielding gas. In addition, for H13 tool steel, hardness values
were similar to that of wrought material. However, for 316 SS clad,
the hardness is much greater than that of conventional cold-rolled ma-
terial because of the rapid solidi ﬁcation throughout the LPF process
[126].
The impact of inter-layer time interval on microhardness values for
316 L SS was obtained according to the longitudinal axis of the samples,where the hardness amounts represent that the single-built set has
lower hardness values (185 HV) even in heat treated condition (157HV
) compared to the nine-built specimens (215 HV). According to this
research, the inter-layer time interval and post heat treatment canhave an effect on the microhardness values of 316 SS [ 118]. It is worth
mentioning that unidirectional and weaving laser scanning path (USPand WSP respectively) do not extremely in ﬂuence the microhardness
of 316 SS, as evident in Fig. 26 . The Vickers hardness values of USP and
WSP samples do not show any signi ﬁcant differences. However, as-
deposited samples have higher hardness values compared to the heat-treated (1050 °C for 1 h) ones, which is in agreement with other re-
searches [ 184].
8.1.2. Hardness for LPB processed parts
A broad range of microhardness values for LPB processed 316 SS can
be obtained by various scanning speeds and hatch spacing, as recentlyreported by Sun et al. [ 128]. The highest value of microhardness re-
ported at an energy volume density of 101.33 J/mm
3was 220 HV
[128], while, the annealed SS316 L samples showed a microhardness
values between 150 and 160 HV. These microhardness values were
lower than the ones reported by Saeidi [ 185] (320 HV). As reported by
Sun [ 128], this difference might be attributed by the amount of amor-
phous nano-scale inclusions and the grain size. In particular, smaller

crohardness [ 128,185].
Another research conducted by Wang et al. [ 186], showed a correla-
tion between the densi ﬁcation level, which depends on the volume en-
ergy density and the grain size. The researchers demonstrated higherhardness values (281.6 HV) at higher densi ﬁcation level, which resulted
in more re ﬁned microstructures [ 186]. At increased energy density, a
coarsening of the cellular dendrites occurs and leads to a decrease inthe microhardness values (267.1 HV) [ 186]. Similar hardness value of
280 HV, is observed in LPB processed single tracks in 316 L austeniticSS [187].
Recently Rashid and coworkers reported the effect of scan strategy
on microhardness of LPB processed 17-4 PH SS [ 188]. The highest hard-
ness value (458 HV) was measured for the samples fabricated with adouble scan strategy compared to the ones with a single scan strategy
[193]. This phenomenon was due to the occurrence of lower percentage
of retained austenite and a higher percentage of martensite [ 188]. How-
ever, for maraging steel, there is negligible effect of scan strategy on the
hardness values, as plotted in Fig. 27 , speci ﬁcally at low scan speeds, and
the same trend is reported for layer thickness [ 77,79,80]. However, at
higher scan speeds, a small drop in micro-hardness values is observed.
Aging has a signi ﬁcant effect on the hardness values of LPB processed
maraging steel, as shown in Fig. 28 , where at 460 °C, the hardness and
the aging time follow a linear relationship; micro-hardness continuesto increase with time without showing over aging. However, the longer
aging time has no signi ﬁcant effect to increase the micro-hardness
values. On the other hand, at elevated temperatures and prolonged du-rations, micro-hardness starts to slightly decrease, which may be be-
cause of the austenite reversion and coarsening of the intermetallic
precipitates. During laser melting, the surrounding material and the fol-
lowing layers are heated up leading to precipitation reactions, which
may be promoted with micro-segregation accompanied with cellular
growth. In LPB, the re-melting process is signi ﬁcantly pronounced to in-
crease the micro-hardness of the parts, since a second round of agingtakes place [ 77,80]. On the other hand, age hardening of LPB produced
maraging steel causes an increase in the hardness up to 58 HRC, whenoptimal aging time and temperature (5 h and 480 °C) is selected.
8.2. Tensile properties
8.2.1. Tensile properties of LPF processed parts
Table 6 lists the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (YS),
and the elongation at failure (EL) for different grade steels processed by
LPF along with reference properties of wrought steels,
[15,118,190 –192]. The UTS and YS of LPF parts are mostly greater than
those synthesized from wrought counterparts, which can be ascribedto the higher cooling rate and grain re ﬁnements [ 15,19
 0,192]. However,
LPF processed steels show lower elongation-to-failure values, which isbelieved to be due to porosity and inclusions inside the products caused
by the poor optimized process conditions.
Fig. 29 a–c shows the speci ﬁc energy vs. UTS, YS and EL values for
various kinds of SS (316SS vs. 420SS) obtained from the literature. For
comparison, different values of normalized powder feed rate ( ζ)a r e
also indicated.
Another interesting feature regarding the tensile properties of LPF
steels is the building orientation of the parts, which affects the resultanttensile properties of the component. A summary of building orientation
effects, e.g. parallel (X-direction) vs. perpendicular (Y-direction), on
tensile properties of steels is listed in Table 6 . It is believed that this an-
isotropic behavior is due to the occurrence of weak interfacial layers,both in Z- and Y-directions, which provides a simple path for shear
bands [ 10,15]. Various cooling rates in these deposition directions
might affect microstructure and mechanical properties.
The laser passing time between each subsequent layer is greater for
X-direction compared to the materials built in the Y- or Z-directions. 0100200300400500600700800

tures for specimens deposited in the X-direction can be obtained [ 199].
However, some authors describe different behavior for 316 SS in
terms of anisotropy, as illustrated in Fig. 30 , where the tensile properties
for LPF steels in X and Y directions, as well as the results for cast and
annealed steels are presented. The mechanical properties of LPF mate-
rials are superior to the cast and annealed wrought ones. Interestingly,
specimens constructed perpendicular to build direction possess higher
tensile strength and poorer elongation than the specimens build along
the parallel direction. However, this is in contrast with other studies. Ac-
cording to the authors, this behavior was the result of the distinct posi-
tioning of grains along the tensile loading direction, together with the
grain size and spacing between inclusions [ 108].
In addition to building orientation, there are other two factors affect-
ing the tensile properties of LPF parts; (i) inter-layer time interval and
(ii) the scanning path. The measured tensile properties for single-
built, nine built 316 SS and their corresponding cast and wrought mate-
rials are listed in Table 6 . It is stated that the YS and UTS of 316 L SS by
LPF is higher than their cast/wrought alloys, whether or not heat treat-ment or process time interval are taken into consideration. In addition,
yield and tensile strengths of the specimens have been increased by
higher layer-to-layer time interval. However, heat treatment candecrease yield/tensile strength. Nine-built specimens show signi ﬁcantly
poor elongation to failure in comparison with the cast and wrought ma-
terials probably due to the reasons such as: ﬂaws within the parts, ﬁner
microstructures and unsteady metallurgical bond between the layers,when the elongation to failures of one-built specimens is similar to
the heat treated ones [ 130].
The impact of scanning path on tensile properties of 316 SS is of in-
terest. Fig. 31 represents the tensile data in both as prepared and heat-
treated condition for 316 SS; built by following unidirectional (USP)
and weaving scanning path (WSP). From the plot, it is evident that the
USP and WSP as-built specimens have higher tensile strength than the
forged parts. However, elongations are signi ﬁcantly lower in compari-
son with forged counterparts. The reasons for this behaviour could bethe presence of ﬁner grains resulted from the rapid solidi ﬁcation of
the material in the LPF process. In addition, inevitable internal stress, ox-idation and porosity might be other disadvantages for ductility. As
displayed in Fig. 31 , the tensile properties are anisotropic for the USP.
The parallel loading direction to the scanning path shows greater tensilestrength compared to the perpendicular one, whereas the elongation is
the opposite. Therefore, it seems that the samples deposited by WSP
have higher performance than the USP and the conventional forging
ones [ 184].
8.2.2. Tensile properties of LPB processed parts
InTable 7 , the tensile properties are listed for different steel grades
fabricated by LPB techniques along with the properties of the wroughtmaterials [ 125]. Ahmadi and coworkers reported about the variation
of the mechanical properties with laser input power, scanning speedand scanning strategy in 316 SS fabricated by LPB [ 200]. In particular
the authors demonstrated that strain and toughness of the samplesare remarkably affected by the laser power. The reason is that as the
laser power increases, greater energy density and complete melting
are reached due to the greater particle fusion. Moreover, the high en-
ergy density reduces the porosity and leads to bigger melt pools, and
eventually the manufactured products density will be increased. The
tensile strength, as well as other mechanical properties are in ﬂuenced
by porosity [ 200]. The authors also studied the variation of the mechan-
ical properties with the scanning direction.

Fig. 31. Tensile properties of 316 SS, as-built, heat-treated and forged specimens with
different scanning paths (unidirectional and weaving) in LPF [ 184].118 H. Fayazfar et al. / Materials and Design 144 (2018) 98 –128In particular, it was demonstrated that the parts fabricated by cross-
hatching with zig-zag scanning showed improved mechanical proper-
ties compared to the parts obtained by the unidirectional scanning
[200]. The enhancement of the tensile strength and toughness is due
to the reduction of porosity induced by the cross-hatching method.
Wang et al. [ 186] also showed that the tensile strength and elonga-
tion values of LPB manufactured 316 SS are in ﬂuenced by the laser en-
ergy density (P
vsl,w h e r e Pis laser power, vis process speed, sis
hatching space and lis layer thickness). From their work, higher tensile
strength is found in LPB processed 316 SS, compared to the wrought
one. The strength properties vary with the processing method, process-
ing parameters and the post-process heating, which affect the micro-
structure [ 125]. Nakamoto and coworkers [ 34], showed that steels
with higher carbon content showed increased values of yield stress.Moreover, for fully dense SLS samples at a given carbon content, the
yield stress is higher for those ones fabricated at a lower energy input.
The tensile property of maraging steels fabricated by the LPB pro-
cess, correlates positively with relative density, as displayed in Fig. 32
(a,b). LPB processed parts show higher strength and hardness values
compared to conventionally aged products, because of the melting
and re-melting process. In addition, aging heat treatment leads to anincrease in ultimate tensile strength and Young's modulus through the
precipitation of intermetallics. However, the elongation is signi ﬁcantly
reduced by age hardening [ 77,79,83]. As relative density of the LPB proc-
essed parts increases, fracture behavior shifts from brittle to ductile.
Ductile fracture results from the growth and joining of micro-cavities,
while brittle fracture behavior is the result of macro-cavities, which
generated throughout the sintering process without suf ﬁcient energy
density.
8.2.3. Tensile properties of BJ printed parts
Binder jetted cellular lattice structures are less stiff with a smaller
elastic modulus compared to the LPB/LPF processed lattice structures,
which is due to the formation of a weak neck connection among the
powder particles in BJ manufacturing process and partially sintered
metal powders [ 21,22]. Consequently, these lattice structures are only
suitable for tissue engineering scaffolds that necessitate microporesfor nutrient diffusion [ 21]. Zhou et al. [ 22] introduced Instrumented In-
dentation Testing (IIT) to measure the Young's modulus of lattice struc-tural parts made by BJ, and depicted a value of 1.50 and 0.446 GPa for
grid lattice sizes of 1.5 and 1 mm, respectively, which are far from 200
GPa for a conventionally processed SS.
8.3. Fatigue property
8.3.1. Background
Fatigue is one of the critical failure modes for the effective design of
many engineering materials. Cyclic loading normally initiates cracks by
accumulating the plastic damage and subsequent propagation of the
cracks [ 208]. Generally, cracks tend to initiate near the surface, where
nominal stresses are often higher (e.g., in bending), and where geomet-ric variations at surfaces (such as machining marks, surface ﬂaws,
notches, etc.) cause stress concentration. Also, material defects (suchas inclusions, second-phase particles, voids, micro-cracks etc.) can pro-
duce stress concentrations to promote crack formation and failure. Thus,
fatigue plays a signi ﬁcant role in the engineering design.
8.3.2. Fatigue strength in LPB processed steel
From the literature, it is already known that high cycle fatigue (HCF)
properties of LPB steels are very sensitive to process-induced porosities
which in ﬂuence premature failure through the crack initiation mecha-
nisms. Fatigue test parameters for some LPB processed steels are sum-marized in Table 8 .
Zhang et al. [ 209] studied the fatigue properties of LPB processed
316 L SS and explored that within a ±30% tolerance limit, porosity
does not invade the HCF properties. Within the optimum processing
level, porosity driven cracking may be in ﬂuenced by solidi ﬁcat
ion de-
fects caused by over-melting and under-melting and degrade fatigue re-sistance. In their experiment, laser powers were varied from 50%, 70%,
100%, 130% and 150%, samples were denoted as 0.5P, 0.7P, P, 1.3P and
1.5P respectively, as shown in Fig. 33 .
A longer fatigue life is observed in 0.7P sample because of the inter-
nal grain growth morphology. Usually grains with less favorable orien-
tation relative to the temperature gradient stop growing at melt pool
boundary. The ﬁner grain sizes with increased grain boundaries act as
obstacles to dislocation motion and promote intergranular crack

longer fatigue life.
Yadollahi et al. [ 137] studied the strain-controlled fatigue behavior
of LPB processed 17-4 PH SS, where four types of samples were consid-
ered; (i) as built horizontal, (ii) as built vertical, (iii) horizontal + heat
treatment, and (iv) vertical + heat treatment. The strain amplitudes
vs. fatigue lives of different LPB 17-4 PH SS is shown in Fig. 34 . For LPB
processed 17-4 PH SS, solution annealing and peak-aging heat treat-
ment is favorable for low cycle fatigue (LCF), and unfavorable for HCF.
This is because the associated impurities from the LPB process make
17-4 PH SS more sensitive and after heat treatment it became harder.
However, as the defect sensitivity in LCF process was less obvious,
after heat treatment specimens showed better fatigue property. Also
the building direction showed signi ﬁcant impact on fatigue properties
in LPB processed parts. In horizontally built sample, higher fatiguestrength was mainly ascribed by their orientation along the loading
axis. In case of vertical specimen, defects were more harmful as they
generated stress concentration during loading.
The effect of scan speed, porosity and microstructure on fatigue
properties of LPB processed maraging steel AISI 18Ni300 was investi-
gated by Santos et al. [ 210]. The result shown in Fig. 35 indicated that
for short lives, fatigue strength in both load control and displacementcontrol is similar. However, for longer life, load control tests show
higher fatigue strength.
8.3.3. Fatigue strength in LPF processed steel
Very few research works have been done on the fatigue properties of
LPF processed steel, among them 300 M steel [ 211], AISI4340 steel
[212,213] AerMet100 [ 214] steel are reported. The experimental detail
of pre and post heat treatment of various laser cladded steels and
their fatigue test parameters are listed in Table 9 . The fatigue behaviour
of the laser cladded material is not simple because of the formation ofcomplex microstructures with different zones (cladding zone, interfa-
cial zone, and heat affected zone) compared to the conventional micro-
structure in steel after heat treatment.
Chew et al. [ 212] characterized the axial fatigue failure of AISI4340
steel where three types of specimens were designed in: Type1: as-clad, Type2: groove-clad-grind, Type3: extended clad-surface grind.
The fatigue behavior of the substrate together with the above men-
tioned cladded samples, is shown in Fig. 36 . In general, laser cladding re-
duced the fatigue life, e.g. Type1 specimen has poor fatigue strengthcompared to Type2 and Type3. In Type1 specimen, the as-clad region
acts as localized stress raiser to initiate crack propagation and failure.
The surface grounded clad toe region in Type2 specimen also enables
to initiate surface cracks with lower propagation rate because of lesser
stress concentration, which results in longer fatigue life. Design of
Type3 specimen reduced the cross-sectional area which improved fa-
tigue behavior though it pass through the surface grinding of the ex-
tended clad.
AISI4340 steel was used as a substrate, where AISI4340 and
AerMet100 clads were produced using laser cladding, and a poor fatigue
life was reported in AISI4340 as-clad compared to AerMet100 clad
[213].Fig. 37 shows a comparison of fatigue life between AISI4340 as-
clad and AerMet100 clad. The reasons for this degradation are summa-rized as: (i) the clad and HAZ region show high hardness and brittle
properties, (2) generation of tensile residual stresses and (3) micro-
structural inhomogeneity, i.e. columnar grains in the clad area and
grain growth in HAZ stimulating inter-granular fracture.
During laser cladding process, the conversion of ferrite from austen-
ite is inhibited because of rapid solidi ﬁcation. As a result, a brittle phase
martensite is formed from austenite. Bhattacharya et al. [ 215] stated a
detailed microstructure development during DMD of AISI4340 steel
powder. In their work, tempered lath martensite was formed in
AISI4340 steel clad.
During laser processing of steel, heating produced by the successive
overlapping tracks will not allow austenite in the earlier track to coolbelow Ms. temperature to form martensite. At the end of the cladding
process, the substrate will solidify which results in the conversion of
austenite to martensite. This brittle and untempered martensite de-
graded fatigue life and showed brittle failure mode in AISI4340 as clad
steel [ 21
2 ,213].
On the other hand, AerMet100 showed increased fatigue life com-
pared to AISI4340. This is because of the following reasons; (1) lowercarbon content of the AerMet100 (0.25 wt%), compared to AISI4340
(0.4 wt%), resulting lower hardness in the clad region, and (2) high
nickel content produced Fe-Ni lath-martensite which stimulate ductil-
ity. After post clad heat treatment (PCHT), the fatigue life is improved
for both clad materials, which is because of the recovery of ductility
and toughness in that region.
9. Metal matrix composites (MMC) in AM
Metal matrix composites (MMCs) are manufactured with metals or
alloys, reinforced with particulates or ﬁbers of other materials with
the objective of high speci ﬁc strength and stiffness, higher operating
temperature/thermal stability, better wear resistance, improved fatigue
strength and the capability to possess these properties for a particular
applications [ 216 –219]. The reinforcement of metal matrix using AM
technology, opens up the possibility of their application in areaswhere light weight material and cost reduction has the priority, like in
automotive, aerospace, and biomedical industries [ 216 –218].
Generally, MMCs are manufactured using conventional techniques,
i.e., casting and powder metallurgy, where some major problems are as-
sociated as follows: (1) In casting method, the required molds and the

low working temperature results weak interfacial bonding between
reinforced particle and the matrix which may deteriorate the me-
chanical property of the composite [ 220], (3) Microstructural inho-
mogeneity is another problem due to the non-uniform distributionof reinforcing element throughout the matrix because of Van der
Waals attraction forces between surrounding particles [ 221]. Com-
pared to the conventional casting, in LPB and LPF AM, melt poolpass through a non-equilibrium solidi ﬁcation due to fast heating
and cooling over a small melt pool area, which lead to ﬁner micro-
structure and homogeneous distribution of reinforcing element
[5,222]. Moreover, AM can reduce processing times and cost by fab-
ricating near net shape with minimum machining and allow to man-ufacture products with complex geometry.
In MMC of ferrous alloys, the common reinforcing element includes
phases of carbides (SiC, TiC, WC), nitrides (TaN, TiN), borides (TiB, TiB
2,
WB), metal oxides (Al 2O3), and carbon ﬁbers [ 139], [217,223,224]. Addi-
tion of second-phase carbides into steel matrix can improve mechanical
properties because of their slow growth rate and thermal stability com-
pared to the cementite [ 217,225]. For example, reinforcement of ther-
modynamically stable TiC in martensitic steel matrix, has proven
improved stiffness, hardness and wear property [ 217]. In laser based
AM, the strong Marangoni convection brought by high thermal capillaryforces caused instability in the melt pool. The liquid ﬂow is generally
obsessed by gravity force, buoyancy force and surface tension in themolten area. Consequently, the redisposition of reinforcing elements
and their subsequent distributions are signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuenced by the
ﬂuidﬂow.9.1. LPB processed MMC
In literature, MMC manufactured using LPB process is limited to two
steel matrix materials (316 L SS, H13 tool steel) and three reinforced
materials or ﬁllers: (titanium carbide (TiC), titanium diboride (TiB
2)
and hydroxyapatite (HA)), as summarized in Table 10 . The as printed
relative density N95% is achieved with TiC and TiB 2but is not reported
for HA [ 216,222,223,225 –228]. Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) treatments
allowed a relative density in the range of 99% + for TiB 2, however this
decreased the wear resistance and hardness when compared to the asprinted condition [ 225,226].
While ﬁller is seen throughout the matrix, it is typically more con-
centrated at solidi ﬁcation cell boundaries forming a continuous net-
work of high ﬁller content regions with a honeycomb like appearance
[216 –218,221,223,225 –230]. The presence of well dispersed high melt-
ing particulate ﬁllers serves as a nucleating agent resulting in grain re-
ﬁnement. As expected from composites theory, well dispersed nano-
ﬁllers produce the strongest effects (e.g. 316 L-15TiC [ 216,221,227]).
Due to the increased nucleation, MMC matrix grains are also moreequiaxed and exhibit weaker crystallographic texture when compared
to un ﬁlled material [ 217,222,227]. Unlike typical LPB builds, columnar
grains in MMC do not extend though the layer due to increased nucle-ation [ 222,223].
In LPB produced MMC, the hardness and wear resistance follow the
expected trends for particulate reinforced composites, namely they are
proportional to ﬁller volume fraction and inversely proportional to ﬁller
size. Despite the lower relative densities of MMC, their properties wereconsistently better than un ﬁlled controls. The most successful ﬁller

pears to be in-situ ﬁller formation during ball milling. The advantages
of in-situ formation over the incorporation of an existing ﬁller are the
decreased ﬁller size, clear and coherent ﬁller/matrix interface [ 218]
and the avoidance of an independent nano-particle production step.
The primary disadvantage is the long-required reaction time (8 –36 h)
[218,228].
9.2. LPF processed MMC
In LPF, majority of researches have been considered TiC as the rein-
forcing material because of their high strength and better wear resis-tance properties, as summarized in Table 11 . The amount of reinforced
TiC has a signi ﬁcant effect on the size and morphology of the TiC in
MMC. Also, various forms of TiC including, spherical, rod, ﬂower-petal,
cubic and dendrite shapes can be formed depending on the laser process
parameters [ 231 –234]. It is worth mentioning that TiC particles could be
undissolved, partially dissolved and completely dissolved in the steelmatrix relying on laser cladding parameters such as, laser power, pow-
der feeding rate, and laser cladding speed. It is found that in most of the
researches on Fe-TiC MMC, defects free coatings can be produced if TiC
is completely dissolved in the steel matrix [ 234 –236]. Also, in otherMMC, containing TiB
2, SiC, VC, Cr 3C2,A l2O3and ZrC as the reinforcing
materials, defect free and favorable metallurgical bond between the
clad and the substrate has been observed [ 237 –240].
The microstructure of the composite coating is generally planar, cel-
lular, dendritic or ﬁne equiaxed grains [ 247,251]. So, laser process pa-
rameters show a critical role in the quality and microstructure of thecomposite clad and the interfacial strength between TiC reinforcing par-ticle and the matrix [ 233,243]. Consequently, they can in ﬂuence the
wear resistance and hardness of the clad layer [ 232,242].
9.3. BJ printed MMC
The process detail of MMC manufactured in BJ technique and their
properties are summarized in Table 12 .
Kuldeep Agarwal's group at the Minnesota State University adopted
BJ AM process to produce porous biocomposites based on SS and tri-calcium phosphate (TCP) with tailored microstructure and mechanical
properties to act as load bearing medical implants [ 254,255]. In their ex-
periment, 316 SS and β-TCP were simply mixed in different volume
fractions. After printing and sintering, β-TCP formed a coating on SS par-
ticles, with higher volume fraction of β-TCP covered more SS particles
[254]. 316SS-20TCP and 316SS-40TCP composites represented an elas-
tic modulus of 7 –30 GPa, within the range of cortical and cancellous
bones. Where, 316SS-40TCP was suited for scaffold applications and
316SS-20TCP composite found to be an excellent candidate for implant
applications [ 254,255].
Scheithauer et al. [ 253] reported a thermoplastic 3D printing ap-
proach to produce metal-ceramic composites using high- ﬁlled
iron chromium alloy/17-4 PH suspension and zirconia suspension inmolten thermoplastic binder systems/dispersing agent with powder
content of 50 vol% steel and 50 vol% zirconia. The process involved pre-
paring suspensions in a heatable ball mill and printing of the suspen-
sions in a layer-by-layer process, which then solidi ﬁed and passed
through the conventional de-binding and sintering [ 252,253]. Un-
wanted secondary phases such as oxides and carbides were formedand precipitated within the grain boundaries and the grown pore
spaces, which could be avoided during heat treatment in inert atmo-
sphere (Ar/H
2)[252]. This process can be adopted for any materials
compositions, considering similar thermal expansion or shrinkage be-havior of the materials, which leads to the formation of defectless
parts with no delamination, structural changes, etc. [ 253].

Metal AM processes have the potential to produce complex near-
net-shape steel components. Various examples were found in the liter-
ature, where dense steel parts with acceptable properties were fabri-
cated. However, there are signi ﬁcant challenges associated with LPB,
LPF and BJ processes; some of the most signi ﬁcant ones are mentioned
below:
1- There is a large number of process/design parameters such as, laser
power, powder feed rate, laser traverse speed, layer thickness, scan-
ning pattern, etc. involved in LPB and LPF manufacturing processes.
As mechanical properties, thermal gradient and consequent micro-
structure of laser fabricated parts depend on the process parameters
and interaction among them, it is vital to optimize these parameters
to achieve near-net-shape components with minimal defects such aspores and inclusions. Therefore, novel and effective statistical ap-proaches are required to consider all interdependencies of parame-
ters while a minimum number of experiments is conducted.
Within the context of new statistical approaches, much attention
must be given to such higher-order interaction effects, which lead
to systematic uncertainty in the resulting models and experimental
achievements. In this regard, choosing the appropriate combined pa-
rameters is of vital importance for the statistical analysis as it is eas-
ier to consider their effect on porosity and mechanical properties of
the AM parts instead of using individual parameters.
2- A vast majority of existing studies only investigate optimal process
parameters for steels using simulation and/or experimental ap-
proach. A signi ﬁcant limitation is that, by changing the experimental
conditions (e.g., material, process, system, or environmental condi-tions), the resulting optimal process parameters might no longer
be applicable. Consequently, new experiments are needed to be

is extremely challenging to consolidate the data available due to the
inconsistencies in the procedures and methodologies used for
extracting data. As the AM community grows, the development of
standard procedures is inevitable to help the community to interpret
the data more effectively and prevent experimental duplication as
much as possible.
3- Building orientation of steel parts fabricated via LPB and LPF may af-
fect their thermal history. This is because of the anisotropic heat con-duction along the built direction. As a result inhomogeneity in
microstructure with elongated grains is formed that eventually
leads to anisotropic mechanical properties. Post process heat treat-
ment may eliminate the anisotropic property, but further investiga-
tion and validation of this approach is required. For example, Hot
Isostatic Pressing (HIP) can signi ﬁcantly decrease the anisotropy in
the building orientation by removing directional porosities; how-ever, the HIP may cause a detrimental dimensional shrinkage. An-
other possible solution that to the best of our knowledge has not
been considered yet in the literature is cooling of the substrate, for
the sake of tempering, as soon as the AM process is completed.
This would need to be carefully examined and effectively controlled.
4- Last but not least, the number of ferrous alloys deployed to AM pro-
cesses is extremely limited. While there are N1000 steel alloys for
conventional manufacturing (casting, forging, machining, etc.),there have not been many steel alloys deployed to AM by re-
searchers and industry to-date. It becomes a more limiting factor
when the number of quali ﬁed steel alloys offered by the AM Original
Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) is b10. Further efforts must be
made to develop new steel alloys, which are better tailored to AM
and also to deploy existing alloys to AM processes, for which immi-
nent market opportunities are expected.

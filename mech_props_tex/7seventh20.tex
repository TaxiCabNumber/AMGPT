D2 Tool Steel can be heat-treated to increase hardness and durability after an optional annealing step and machining work. Markforged recommends heat-treating D2 Tool Steel to optimize material properties for target applications.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Slowly heat to $760^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(1400^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$, hold at temperature for 30 minutes minimum.

  \item Heat to $1040^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(1904^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$. Hold part at temperature for $30-45$ minutes.

  \item Air quench part to below $65^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(150^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.

  \item Temper part. For each temper, heat part to $200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(392^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ and temper for 30 minutes. If double tempering, let part cool to room temperature between tempers. Note: Higher temperature tempers may also be used — which will increase toughness but reduce hardness.
\footnotetext{  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Markforged heat-treated D2 Tool Steel was heated to $1040^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(1904^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ and single tempered at $200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(392^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ for 30 minutes.

    \item Wrought heat treatment data from Bohler-Uddeholm: \href{http://cdna.terasrenki.com/ds/1.2379_X153CrMoV12_AISI-D2_SS-2310_Datasheet_2.pdf}{http://cdna.terasrenki.com/ds/1.2379\_X153CrMoV12\_AISI-D2\_SS-2310\_Datasheet\_2.pdf}

    \item Markforged hardness was measured on sample coupons that were printed with solid fill.

    \item Relative density for D2 Tool Steel assumes a density of $7.7 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$.

    \item As-sintered hardness can vary significantly based on furnace loading and ambient environment. Markforged recommends post-sinter heat treatment for maximum hardness and compression strength.

OF SMALL AND

COMPLEX

METAL PARTS

\section*{RAPID 3D PRINTING \\
 FOR YOU}
The proprietary technology of Digital Meta ${ }^{\circledR}$ is making great strides into territories previously ruled by conventional manufacturing technologies. High productivity, excellent surface quality and great resolution have brought our 3D metal printing services out of the prototyping phase, and into large series manufacturing. This is what's in it for you.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2024_03_11_54e4b04eb5efe63bec03g-03}
\end{center}

\section*{WHAT'S SO GOOD ABOUT IT?}
For a start, the process requires no complex or costly tools and keeps waste material down to an absolute minimum. But that's not all. Here are just a few of the other advantages:

\section*{CERTIFIED FOR YOUR SECURITY}
\begin{itemize}
  \item CE-Certified in accordace with EC Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC

  \item UL-Certified, file nr. E496006

\end{itemize}

\section*{'IMPOSSIBLE' OBJECTS BECOME POSSIBLE}
$3 \mathrm{D}$ metal printing enables the production of complex objects that would be costly - if not impossible to produce - using conventional methods. This is music to the ears of industrial designers, who can at last unleash their full creativity and explore the new territory that 3D metal printing opens up.

\section*{FAST TRACK FROM CONCEPT}
\section*{TO COMPLETION}
In today's fast-paced, competitive environment, producers face ever shorter product life cycles and ever greater product variety. You need new, quicker ways to innovate and get your innovations to market. 3D printing is the answer. With this technology, Digital Metal can take your product from concept to completion in a short time.

\section*{COST-EFFECTIVE PRODUCTION}
Not only does 3D metal printing provide a much more costeffective way of manufacturing complex metal parts, it is also the ideal solution.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2024_03_11_54e4b04eb5efe63bec03g-04}
\end{center}

The DM P2500 is a robust machine for both serial production and prototyping.

\section*{WHERE CAN YOU USE IT?}
\section*{INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS}
$3 D$ metal printing makes it possible to quickly and costeffectively produce complex metal components for industrial use. They can be hollow or meshed, with undercuts, ducts, cavities and internal structures. Almost any design, no matter how complicated, is achieveable using this technique.

\section*{DENTAL/MEDICAL}
Dental/medical 3D metal printing also opens up the possibility of making radically new tools and components designed for optimal functionality instead of complying to the restrictions of traditional manufacturing.

\section*{AEROSPACE}
By making lightweight but strong metal components, with hollow or meshed interiors, Digital Metal can also contribute to advances in aircraft design.

\section*{DESIGN}
3D metal printing enables a whole new level of creative freedom!

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2024_03_11_54e4b04eb5efe63bec03g-04(1)}
\end{center}

\section*{THIS IS HOW IT WORKS}
Are you looking for an additive manufacturing (AM) system that delivers fine tolerances, surface finish and resolution, while maximizing productivity for small complex components? Then high-precision binder jetting on powder bed is the solution you are looking for.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2024_03_11_54e4b04eb5efe63bec03g-05(2)}
\end{center}

\section*{LAYER BY LAYER}
Our process begins with an object described in a CAD file. This is materialised in our $3 \mathrm{D}$ printer, which builds the object layer by layer, using metal powder and high-precision binder jetting. Once complete, the object is sintered for strength.

The result? A metal component with high resolution and tolerance. An additional third step can be added to refine surface quality.

Digital Metal offers a range of different materials to print with. New materials are constantly under development and will be readily available after rigorous testing.

\section*{DETAIL ACCURACY}
Growing up, this man probably never expected turning into a man of steel, 10 mm tall. However, unlike a well-known super hero, this transformation from human to steel will not pass unnoticed. The very fine detail makes it impossible to keep his true identity safe.

\section*{ITSY BITSY}
It may be hard to grasp the small size of this pair of happy twins. Apart from the precision required, our small friends visualise yet another advantage of Digital Metal: high productivity. In just one batch, we are able to manufacture very large numbers of similar, or - even better dissimilar objects.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2024_03_11_54e4b04eb5efe63bec03g-06(5)}
\end{center}

\section*{INTERNAL CHANNELS}
A major advantage of Digital Metal is the free form design capability offered. Nowhere is this more evident than in the case of internal channels that easily can be utilised to provide complex, optimised internal structures. The average surface quality of merely $\operatorname{Ra} 6 \mu$ ensures a good flow in the channels.

\section*{INTEGRATED DESIGN}
The pea of the whistle is not visible, but rest assured - it is in there. In our 3D printing process, the integrated pea is built resting on the surrounding layers of metal powder. Once the powder is removed, prepare yourself to get blown away.

\section*{ADVANCED GEOMETRY}
This complex geometry is a prime example of what Digital Metal is all about: making the seemingly impossible possible. Simply put, this is what we call design beyond your imagination.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2024_03_11_54e4b04eb5efe63bec03g-06(1)}
\end{center}

\end{center}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2024_03_11_54e4b04eb5efe63bec03g-06(4)}
\end{center}

\section*{SERIAL PRODUCTION OF CUSTOMISED PARTS}
In the manufacturing of small and complex components, Digital Metal is a very competitive alternative to conventional mass production technologies. You may also consider the possibility of making every part a unique product.

\section*{HIGH-VOLUME PRODUCTION}
Small part sizes means there is plenty of room for large numbers of components to be printed simultaneously. This is in particular true for Digital Metal. Our high-precision process does not require any support structures, nor does it involve any heat transfer, which means we are able to pack the build box densely. Required spacing between parts to be printed is less than 1 millimetre. Parts can be placed in several layers on top of each other.

Printing without support structures also minimizes waste and post treatment, which speeds up the production process. The high productivity explains why Digital Metal today is one of the first service providers in the world supplying large series of $3 \mathrm{D}$ printed products.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2024_03_11_54e4b04eb5efe63bec03g-07(1)}
\end{center}

\section*{MASS CUSTOMISATION}
There is time to be saved and money to be earned taking a closer look at the flexibility of Digital Metal. Every single part in a batch of components can be custom-made, no matter the number. This opens up for creative thinking and added marketing value as you are able to supply products customised for your market. Consequently, Digital Metal also enables simultaneous printing of different product series in the same production run.

\section*{SURFACE QUALITY}
With the Digital Metal technology, an average surface quality of Ra 6 m can be obtained already without any post processing, while other AM processes typically leave a much rougher surface. Surface quality is important for components with internal channels, as post processing of those surfaces are very challenging. Additional operations can be added on external surfaces to achieve a surface that matches your specific need.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2024_03_11_54e4b04eb5efe63bec03g-08(4)}
\end{center}

As sintered, an average surface quality of Ra $6.0 \mu \mathrm{m}$ is achievable.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2024_03_11_54e4b04eb5efe63bec03g-08(3)}
\end{center}

Peening, blasting and tumbling increase surface quality to an average of $\mathrm{Ra} 3.0 \mu \mathrm{m}$.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2024_03_11_54e4b04eb5efe63bec03g-08}
\end{center}

Superfinish enables even higher surface quality, around Ra $1.0 \mu \mathrm{m}$.

\section*{EOS NickeIAlloy HX}
EOS NickelAlloy HX is a nickel metal alloy powder intended for processing on

EOS DMLS systems.

This document provides information and data for parts built using EOS NickelAlloy HX powder (EOS art.-no. 9011-0023) on the following specifications:

\begin{itemize}
  \item EOS DMLS system M400-4
  \item EOSYSTEM: EOSPRINT v.1.5/HCS v.2.4.14
  \item EOS Parameter set HX FlexLine 40um
\end{itemize}

\section*{Description}
EOS NickelAlloy HX is a nickel-chromium-iron-molybdenum alloy in fine powder form. Its composition corresponds to UNS N06002. While the wrought and cast versions of the alloy generally are solution annealed, the laser sintered version has a high strength and good elongation already in the as-built condition. Solution annealing of the laser sintered material will homogenize the microstructure, relax internal stresses and increase the elongation, while slightly decreasing the strength.

This type of alloy is characterized by having high strength and oxidation resistance also at elevated temperatures, and is often used up to $1200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Therefore its applications can be found in aerospace technology, gas turbine parts, etc.

Parts built from EOS NickelAlloy HX can be heat treated and material properties can be varied within specified range. In both as-built and solution heat treated states the parts can be machined, spark-eroded, welded, micro shot-peened, polished, and coated if required. Unexposed powder can be reused.

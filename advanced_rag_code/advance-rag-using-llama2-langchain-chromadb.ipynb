      " everybody knows that Linear Regression is a statistical method used to establish a relationship between two or more variables. But do you know the history of Linear Regression?\n",
      "\n",
      "The history of linear regression can be traced back to the early 19th century when Karl Friedrich Gauss, a German mathematician and astronomer, first introduced the concept of linear regression. Gauss observed that the relationship between the height of a person and their weight could be modeled using a linear equation, and he developed a method for estimating the parameters of such a model.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early 20th century, the concept of linear regression was further developed by other statisticians, including R.A. Fisher and S.S. Wilks. Fisher, in particular, made significant contributions to the field of linear regression, including the development of statistical methods for analyzing the results of experiments and the introduction of the concept of least squares estimation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1950s and 1960s, linear regression became a popular method for analyzing data in a wide range of fields, including economics, social sciences, and medicine. The development of electronic computers made it possible to perform linear regression analyses on large datasets, and the technique became an essential tool for researchers in many fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, linear regression has continued to evolve, with new methods and techniques being developed to address specific challenges and applications. For example, linear regression has been extended to handle non-linear relationships between variables, and new methods have been developed for analyzing data with missing values or outliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, linear regression remains a fundamental tool in statistics and data analysis, with applications in fields ranging from finance and marketing to medicine and public health. Its flexibility, simplicity, and ability to handle complex data sets make it an essential method for anyone working with data.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, linear regression is a powerful statistical method that has a rich history dating back to the early 19th century. From its origins in the work of Karl Friedrich Gauss to its modern applications in a wide range of fields, linear regression has evolved into an essential tool for anyone working with data. Its flexibility, simplicity, and ability to handle complex data sets make it an essential method for anyone working with data.\n"

      "Answer: Linear regression is a type of machine learning algorithm that is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (life satisfaction) and one or more independent variables (GDP per capita). In simple linear regression, the model makes a prediction by computing a weighted sum of the input features, where the weights are learned during the training process. The goal of linear regression is to minimize the distance between the model's predictions and the actual values of the dependent variable. In the book, the authors explain that linear regression is a linear function of the input features, and the parameters of the model (θ0 and θ1) are learned using a cost function that measures the distance between the model's predictions and the training examples.\n"

      "Answer: Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on complex neural networks with multiple layers. These networks are capable of learning and representing patterns in data, such as images, speech, or text. The term \"deep learning\" was coined to describe the use of these complex neural networks, which were previously known as artificial neural networks (ANNs). Deep learning is particularly useful for tasks that involve processing and analyzing large amounts of data, such as image recognition, speech recognition, or natural language processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the book, the author covers various topics related to deep learning, including the different types of neural networks, such as feedforward neural nets, convolutive nets, recurrent nets, long short-term memory (LSTM) nets, autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). The book also discusses techniques for training deep neural networks, scaling neural networks for large datasets, and handling uncertainty with Bayesian deep learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author emphasizes that deep learning is not a replacement for simpler machine learning techniques, such as random forests and ensemble methods, but rather a complement to them. Deep learning is best suited for complex problems that cannot be solved using simpler techniques. The book provides a comprehensive introduction to deep learning, including the mathematical concepts and practical implementation using popular libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.\n"

      "8in the 1990s, an ann with more than two hidden layers was considered deep. nowadays, it is common to see anns with dozens of layers, or even hundreds, so the definition of “ deep ” is quite fuzzy. 9 “ learning internal representations by error propagation, ” d. rumelhart, g. hinton, r. williams ( 1986 ). multi - layer perceptron and backpropagation an mlp is composed of one ( passthrough ) input layer, one or more layers of tlus, called hidden layers, and one final layer of tlus called the output layer ( see figure 10 - 7 ). the layers close to the input layer are usually called the lower layers, and the ones close to the outputs are usually called the upper layers. every layer except the output layer includes a bias neuron and is fully connected to the next layer. figure 10 - 7. multi - layer perceptron the signal flows only in one direction ( from the inputs to the out ‐ puts ), so this architecture is an example of a feedforward neural net ‐ work ( fnn ). when an ann contains a deep stack of hidden layers8, it is called a deep neural net ‐ work ( dnn )\n",

      "2 “ a logical calculus of ideas immanent in nervous activity, ” w. mcculloch and w. pitts ( 1943 ). in the first part of this chapter, we will introduce artificial neural networks, starting with a quick tour of the very first ann architectures, leading up to multi - layer per ‐ ceptrons ( mlps ) which are heavily used today ( other architectures will be explored in the next chapters ). in the second part, we will look at how to implement neural net ‐ works using the popular keras api. this is a beautifully designed and simple high - level api for building, training, evaluating and running neural networks. but don ’ t be fooled by its simplicity : it is expressive and flexible enough to let you build a wide variety of neural network architectures. in fact, it will probably be sufficient for most of your use cases. moreover, should you ever need extra flexibility, you can always write custom keras components using its lower - level api, as we will see in chap ‐ ter 12. but first, let ’ s go back in time to see how artificial neural networks came to be! from biological to artificial neurons surprisingly, anns have been around for quite a while : they were first introduced back\n",
      "14 “ wide & deep learning for recommender systems, ” heng - tze cheng et al. ( 2016 ). as you can see, the sequential api is quite easy to use. however, although sequential models are extremely common, it is sometimes useful to build neural networks with more complex topologies, or with multiple inputs or outputs. for this purpose, keras offers the functional api. building complex models using the functional api one example of a non - sequential neural network is a wide & deep neural network. this neural network architecture was introduced in a 2016 paper by heng - tze cheng et al. 14. it connects all or part of the inputs directly to the output layer, as shown in figure 10 - 13. this architecture makes it possible for the neural network to learn both deep patterns ( using the deep path ) and simple rules ( through the short path ). in contrast, a regular mlp forces all the data to flow through the full stack of layers, thus simple patterns in the data may end up being distorted by this sequence of transfor ‐ mations. 304 | chapter 10 : introduction to artificial neural networks with keras figure 10 - 13. wide and deep neural network let ’ s build such a neural network to tackle the california housing problem\n",

       "'14 “ wide & deep learning for recommender systems, ” heng - tze cheng et al. ( 2016 ). as you can see, the sequential api is quite easy to use. however, although sequential models are extremely common, it is sometimes useful to build neural networks with more complex topologies, or with multiple inputs or outputs. for this purpose, keras offers the functional api. building complex models using the functional api one example of a non - sequential neural network is a wide & deep neural network. this neural network architecture was introduced in a 2016 paper by heng - tze cheng et al. 14. it connects all or part of the inputs directly to the output layer, as shown in figure 10 - 13. this architecture makes it possible for the neural network to learn both deep patterns ( using the deep path ) and simple rules ( through the short path ). in contrast, a regular mlp forces all the data to flow through the full stack of layers, thus simple patterns in the data may end up being distorted by this sequence of transfor ‐ mations. 304 | chapter 10 : introduction to artificial neural networks with keras figure 10 - 13. wide and deep neural network let ’ s build such a neural network to tackle the california housing problem'"

       "'8in the 1990s, an ann with more than two hidden layers was considered deep. nowadays, it is common to see anns with dozens of layers, or even hundreds, so the definition of “ deep ” is quite fuzzy. 9 “ learning internal representations by error propagation, ” d. rumelhart, g. hinton, r. williams ( 1986 ). multi - layer perceptron and backpropagation an mlp is composed of one ( passthrough ) input layer, one or more layers of tlus, called hidden layers, and one final layer of tlus called the output layer ( see figure 10 - 7 ). the layers close to the input layer are usually called the lower layers, and the ones close to the outputs are usually called the upper layers. every layer except the output layer includes a bias neuron and is fully connected to the next layer. figure 10 - 7. multi - layer perceptron the signal flows only in one direction ( from the inputs to the out ‐ puts ), so this architecture is an example of a feedforward neural net ‐ work ( fnn ). when an ann contains a deep stack of hidden layers8, it is called a deep neural net ‐ work ( dnn )'"

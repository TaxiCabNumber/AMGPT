Chicago pizza is the best. It’s deep dish, it’s thick, it’s cheesy, and it’s just all
around delicious. I can’t stand thin crust pizza, it’s just not worth my time.
And don’t even get me started on New York-style pizza, it’s just a joke. And
another thing, I think pineapples on pizza are an abomination. I mean, who

it’s just a mess. But hey, I’m open to trying new things, so if you have any

There could be several reasons why people might
think you like fried chicken. Here are a few possibili-
ties:
1. Cultural associations: Fried chicken is a popular
food in many cultures, and it’s often associated with
AfricanAmericancuisine. Ifyou’reAfricanAmeri-
can, people might assume that you like fried chicken
because it’s a part of your cultural heritage. 2. [...]

from the perspectives of truthfulness, toxicity, and bias.
Truthfulness. To understand the ability of LLMs to generate reliable outputs that agree with factuality and
commonsense,weemployTruthfulQA(Linetal.,2021),usedforLLMhallucinationstomeasurewhether
alanguagemodelistruthfulingeneratinganswerstoquestionswhilebeinginformativeatthesametime.
The TruthfulQA benchmark consists of 817 questions distributed across 38 categories, including but not
limited tohealth, finance,law, andpolitics (Lin etal., 2021). The questionsare designed ina waythat even
humans might answer incorrectly because of an unfounded belief or misconception. Following Lin et al.
(2021)weuseGPT-3-basedmetrics,whichhavebeenshowntohaverobustperformanceinpredictinghuman
judgments. Specifically, a fine-tuned GPT-3 model¶¶, i.e. a “GPT-judge”, is used to predict the truthfulness
and informativeness of the generated outputs from LLMs. For the QA prompt, we adopt a few-shot prompt
containing 6 random QA pairs with the formats following InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022). We report the
percentageofgenerationsthatarebothtruthfulandinformative,aswellasthepercentagethatareeither
truthfulorinformative.
Toxicity. Tomeasurethedegreeofgenerationoftoxiclanguageandhatespeechacrossdifferentgroups,we
useToxiGen(Hartvigsenetal.,2022),adatasetthatcontainsimplicitlytoxicandbenignsentencesmentioning
13 minority groups. We adopt a revised version of the dataset from Hosseini et al. (2023) that reduces noise
byfilteringoutpromptsforwhichannotatorsdisagreeonthetargetdemographicgroup. Wethenusethe
default ToxiGen classifier tuned on RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) to measure the toxicity of generations of each
of the LLMs.
Bias.To study the sentiment in model generations that may vary with demographic attributes, we choose
BOLD(Dhamalaetal.,2021),alarge-scalebiasbenchmarkthatcomprises23,679EnglishWikipediaprompts
spanning five domains of race, gender, religion, political ideology, and profession, with 43 different sub-

A.4.8 Automatic Safety Benchmark Evaluation Results
Fine-grainedAnalysisofToxicity,Truthfulness,andBias. Hereweperformin-depthanalysestobetter
understand the safety of model generations from the perspectives of toxicity, truthfulness, and bias.
•Truthfulness. Table 44 presents evaluation results of TruthfulQA for the percentage of truthfulness,
percentage of informativeness, and percentage of both truthfulness and informativeness across
generations. Most of the models show a >90% informativeness in the model generations. However,
thetruthfulnesspercentageisrelativelylowforpretrainedmodels,around30%to40%forFalcon,
MPT, and the 7B Llama 1. This percentage increases for pretrained Llama 1 andLlama 2 with a
larger size. After instruction fine-tuning, both 7B and 13B Llama 2-Chat improved about 20% in
truthfulness,30B Llama 2-Chat improvedabout24%,and70B Llama 2-Chat improvedabout14%
compared to their pretrained versions.
•Toxicity. Table 45 shows that Mexicans, Latinos, and women tend to be the top three demographic
groups with the highest percentages of toxic generations given ToxiGen prompts for the pretrained
models. Thanks to instruction fine-tuning, fine-tuned Llama 2-Chat models of all sizes show an
effectivelyzeropercentageoftoxicmodelgenerations,andhencetheirresultsarenotpresentedhere.
•Bias.Tables 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50 present the distribution of sentiment scores across different
demographic groupsunder the domains of race,gender,religious ideology, political ideology, and
profession. Overall, we observe positive sentiment scores for each domain in the BOLD dataset for

is used for “informative".
∗∗∗In this analysis, we remove prompts that fall into the religious ideology subgroups Hinduism and Atheism, because
they are underrepresented with only 12 and 29 prompts, respectively.

Additionally, benchmarks typically assess language understanding and generation based on individual
sentences or prompts, but in chat scenarios, context is important. The ability of a fine-tuned chat model
tomaintaincontext,handlenuancedsituations,andavoidgeneratingtoxiccontentwithinaconversation
may not be thoroughly evaluated by existing benchmarks. In the BOLD dataset, the prompts extracted from
Wikipediaaretakentobethefirstfivewordsplusthedomainterm,resultinginpromptsinBOLDhavingsix
to nine words, depending on the domain and demographic group (Dhamala et al., 2021).
After deployment, safety in chat models involves user experience and long-term effects, which are not
captured by benchmarks alone. Therefore, to assess safety effectively, additional testing of how they are
integrated in a product deployment, how they are used, and what metrics accurately and precisely capture
safety risks given the product context is essential for a comprehensive evaluation of safety. Our future work

A.5 Data Annotation
We have relied on human annotators in order to collect annotations for the supervised fine-tuning stage and
human preferences to train the reward models. In this section, we provide details about the data annotation
process.

A.5.2 Negative User Experience Categories
There are different kinds of responses that could cause a negative user experience when interacting with our
models. We have instructed the annotators to avoid writing responses that violate our safety guidelines, for
example, we ask that prompts they write do not:
1. Promote or enable criminal activities.
2. Promote or enable dangerous behaviors to the user or other people.
3. Contain, promote or enable offensive and abusive behavior towards the user or other people.
4. Contain, promote or enable sexually explicit content.

A.6 Dataset Contamination
Withtheincreasingscaleofpubliclyavailabletrainingdata,ithasbecomeinevitablethatsomeportionof
evaluation data is seen during training, and may provide an undue boost in evaluation performance.
Earlierwork(Brownetal.(2020),Weietal.(2022a),Duetal.(2022)inmeasuringsuchdatasetcontamination
considered an example from an evaluation set to be “contaminated” if there existed a collision between
a high-order n-gram (generally, n= 13) from the sample and the training data. This was a deliberately
conservativeapproachinordertoproducea“clean”subsetofthedatawithhighprecision,andisusedin
open-sourced evaluation libraries (e.g. Gao et al. (2021)).
This approach, however, was unable to detect precisely what proportion of a given sample is contaminated,
and didn’t take into account how evaluation datasets are constructed. Furthermore, as noted in Chowdhery
etal.(2022),somedatasets(suchasBoolQ)containcontextsextractedverbatimfromtheweb,butnotthe
questionandanswercontinuation. Assuch,highlycontaminatedsamplesfromthesedatasetsareunlikely
togainanunfairadvantage. ThemethodologyinChowdheryetal.(2022)furtherimprovesontheearlier
n-gram collision detection by considering a sample to be contaminated if 70% of all 8-grams can be found at
least once in the training data.
The previous methodologies noted above all consider contamination in text space, and don’t appear to
considertheformattingofpromptsusedforactualevaluation. Incontrast,weinsteadmatchontokenized
input,beingcarefultopassfullyverbalizedevaluationsamplestothetokenizer. Wealsodivergefromthe
previous methodologies by considering contamination from a bottom-up perspective. We consider a token
tobecontaminatedifitappearsinanytoken n-gramlongerthan10tokensinboththeevaluationsample
and the training set, and define the contamination percentage of a sample to be the percentage of tokens
contaminated. Thisallowsustoviewthebenchmarkperformanceofourmodelsonarangeofcontamination
scales, while retaining the ability to test a high-precision clean subset (samples with <20%contamination)
and a high-precision contaminated subset (samples with >80%contamination). In order to account for the
vagaries of the precise format of verbalized samples, we allow a small "skipgram budget" of four tokens, so
that matchedspans between anevaluation sampleand the trainingdata can differin at mostfour positions
(we do not allow trailing mismatches, or mismatches in the first 10 tokens).
We identify such 10(+)-skipgrams with suffix arrays implemented using a variation of the library from Lee
etal.(2022),modifiedtoworkonaPySparkcluster(effectivelywithoutrandomaccesstodisk). Giventhe
embarrassinglyparallelnatureofthetask,weareabletofindallsuch10-grams(andtheirfulllengths)in
our entire dataset in around seven hours (including time to tokenize), utilizing an estimated 1,500 cores.
As there are many confounding factors at play when determining whether dataset contamination has
contributedtoevaluationperformance(mostlystemmingfromthefactthat"clean"and"dirty"subsetsdo
not necessarily well-estimate the population distribution), we make the following assumption: In the event
of dataset contamination contributing to evaluation performance, we expect both the "cleanest" examples to
haveanoverall worseaveragescorethantheircomplement,andthe"dirtiest"samplestohaveanoverall better
average score than their complement. It is insufficient evidence for contamination if only one of these were
true. To this end, we define four (non-disjoint) subset types as follows:
•“Clean”samples, with less than 20% token contamination,
•“Not clean” samples, with greater than (or equal to) 20% token contamination,
•“Not dirty” samples, with less than 80% token contamination,
•“Dirty”samples, with greater than (or equal to) 80% token contamination.

Table 51: Contamination analysis results for affected datasets. No other evaluation datasets had sufficient
evidence to be considered affected by contamination. Avg. Contam. % denotes the average per-sample
contamination percentage for the given subset type. Models sizes refer to pretrained-only models
may appear contaminated, by virtue of many tokens appearing in matched sequences found in the training
data. However, the matched sequences might be highly fragmented across the training data, in which case it
is very unlikely the model saw the correctly-assembled contaminated sequences during training. To reduce
the chance of this phenomenon, we repeat our analysis with minimum match length L∈ {10,20,30,40,50}.
Sinceinthelimitof L→ ∞everysamplefallsintoboththe"clean"and"notdirty"(thereisnocontamination),
we report the largest Lfor each dataset that appeared to benefit from contamination to strike a balance
between fragmentation and overall contamination.

Hardware and Software (Section 2.2)
Training Factors We usedcustomtraininglibraries, Meta’sResearchSuperCluster, andproduc-
tionclustersforpretraining. Fine-tuning,annotation,andevaluationwerealso
performed on third-party cloud compute.
Carbon Footprint Pretraining utilized a cumulative 3.3M GPU hours of computation on hardware
of type A100-80GB (TDP of 350-400W). Estimated total emissions were 539
tCO 2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.
Training Data (Sections 2.1 and 3)
Overview Llama 2 was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available
sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as
wellasoveronemillionnewhuman-annotatedexamples. Neitherthepretraining
nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.
Data Freshness The pretraining data has a cutoff of September 2022, but some tuning data is
more recent, up to July 2023.
Evaluation Results
See evaluations for pretraining (Section 2); fine-tuning (Section 3); and safety (Section 4).
Ethical Considerations and Limitations (Section 5.2)
Llama 2 is a new technology that carries risks with use. Testing conducted to date has been in
English, and has notcovered, nor could it coverall scenarios. For these reasons, aswith all LLMs,
Llama 2’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances
produceinaccurateorobjectionableresponsestouserprompts. Therefore,beforedeployingany
applications of Llama 2, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their
specific applications of the model. Please see the Responsible Use Guide available available at
